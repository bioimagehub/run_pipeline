# Socket Type Validation & Node Deletion

## Summary

Implemented two key features for the pipeline designer:

### 1. Socket Type Validation with Visual Feedback

**Problem**: Users could connect sockets with incompatible types (e.g., `glob_pattern` to `string`) without any warning, leading to potential pipeline errors.

**Solution**: 
- Added real-time type checking when connecting nodes
- Socket handles (connection dots) now change color based on connection validity:
  - **Gray (#999)**: Unconnected socket
  - **Green (#4CAF50)**: Valid connection with matching types
  - **Red (#f48771)**: Invalid connection with mismatched types
- Connection edges are also styled differently:
  - Valid connections: Solid blue line
  - Invalid connections: Dashed red line with animation

**Type Compatibility Rules**:
```typescript
// Exact match is always valid
glob_pattern ‚Üí glob_pattern ‚úì
string ‚Üí string ‚úì

// Flexible matching allowed
path ‚Üí string ‚úì
path ‚Üí glob_pattern ‚úì
glob_pattern ‚Üí string ‚úì (with visual warning)

// Incompatible
glob_pattern ‚Üí bool ‚úó
string ‚Üí number ‚úó
```

**Implementation**:
- `Canvas.tsx`: Added `areTypesCompatible()` function and validation in `onConnect()`
- `CLINode.tsx`: Added `getSocketColor()` function to dynamically color socket handles
- `globals.css`: Added CSS for invalid edge styling with dashed animation

**User Experience**:
- Connections are NOT blocked even if types don't match (to allow flexibility)
- Visual feedback immediately shows the user if there's a type mismatch
- Console logs warnings for debugging
- Tooltip on socket handles shows the socket type

### 2. Node Deletion via Keyboard

**Problem**: Users had no keyboard shortcut to delete nodes, only a button that appeared when the node was selected.

**Solution**:
- Added Delete key handler in `Canvas.tsx`
- Smart detection prevents deletion when typing in input fields
- Works with the existing delete button in the node header

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// In Canvas.tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.key === 'Delete' && selectedNode) {
      const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
      const isTyping = target.tagName === 'INPUT' || target.tagName === 'TEXTAREA' || target.isContentEditable;
      
      if (!isTyping) {
        e.preventDefault();
        deleteSelectedNode();
      }
    }
  };
  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
}, [selectedNode, deleteSelectedNode]);
```

**Safety Features**:
- Only works when a node is selected
- Ignores Delete key when user is typing in any input field
- Prevents accidental deletion during text editing

**User Workflow**:
1. Click on a node to select it
2. Press Delete key OR click the üóëÔ∏è Delete button
3. Node and all its connections are removed
4. Undo/redo history is updated

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/components/Canvas.tsx**
   - Added `areTypesCompatible()` function
   - Enhanced `onConnect()` with type validation
   - Added keyboard Delete handler with focus detection
   - Added `selectedNode` and `deleteSelectedNode` from store

2. **frontend/src/components/nodes/CLINode.tsx**
   - Added `areTypesCompatible()` helper
   - Added `getSocketColor()` for dynamic socket colors
   - Updated Handle components with dynamic colors and tooltips
   - Fixed delete button to call store function directly

3. **frontend/src/styles/globals.css**
   - Added CSS for invalid edge styling
   - Added dashed line animation for type mismatches

4. **frontend/src/App.tsx**
   - Updated comment about Delete key handling

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Type Validation Testing**:
   - Connect a `convert_to_tif` node (outputs `glob_pattern`) to another node expecting `glob_pattern` ‚Üí should be green
   - Connect a `glob_pattern` output to a `string` input ‚Üí should turn red
   - Verify edge styling changes to dashed red line
   - Check tooltip shows socket type on hover

2. **Delete Key Testing**:
   - Select a node and press Delete ‚Üí node should be removed
   - Click in an input field and press Delete ‚Üí should delete characters, NOT the node
   - Try with textarea and contentEditable elements
   - Verify undo/redo works after deletion

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Multiple nodes selected? (ReactFlow might handle this)
   - Rapid connection/disconnection
   - Complex type chains (A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC with type mismatches)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Type Compatibility**:
   - Could add a type conversion dialog when connecting incompatible types
   - Auto-insert converter nodes (e.g., string ‚Üí glob_pattern converter)
   
2. **Batch Operations**:
   - Delete multiple selected nodes (Ctrl+Click)
   - Shift+Delete for "force delete" without confirmation

3. **Better UX**:
   - Show type name on socket hover
   - Add icon indicators on sockets (üî¢ for number, üìÑ for string, etc.)
   - Connection preview showing if it will be valid before dropping

4. **Validation Panel**:
   - Add a panel showing all type mismatches in the pipeline
   - Quick-fix buttons to resolve issues

## Notes

- Type validation is non-blocking to maintain flexibility
- Users can still create "invalid" pipelines and see what happens
- The visual feedback should be obvious enough to catch errors early
- Delete key is the standard across most node editors (Blender, Unreal, etc.)
