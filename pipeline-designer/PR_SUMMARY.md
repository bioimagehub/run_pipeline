# Pull Request: Socket Type Validation & Node Deletion

## Overview

This PR implements two critical UX improvements for the BIPHUB Pipeline Designer:

1. **Socket Type Validation with Visual Feedback** - Color-coded connection handles that warn users about type mismatches
2. **Keyboard Node Deletion** - Delete key support with smart input field detection

## Motivation

### Problem 1: Silent Type Mismatches
Users could connect incompatible socket types (e.g., `glob_pattern` â†’ `string`) without any visual warning. This led to runtime errors that were hard to debug.

### Problem 2: No Keyboard Workflow
Users had to click a button to delete nodes, breaking their keyboard-focused workflow. No standard Delete key support.

## Solution

### Visual Type Validation System
- **Color-coded socket handles**: Gray (unconnected) â†’ Green (valid) â†’ Red (invalid)
- **Animated edge styling**: Dashed red lines for type mismatches
- **Non-blocking**: Users can still create any connection, but get immediate visual feedback
- **Tooltip support**: Hover over sockets to see their type

### Smart Delete Key Handler
- **Delete key support**: Press Delete to remove selected nodes
- **Focus detection**: Doesn't interfere with text editing in input fields
- **Safety checks**: Only works when a node is selected
- **Undo support**: Works with existing undo/redo system

## Implementation Details

### Type Compatibility Function
```typescript
const areTypesCompatible = (sourceType: string, targetType: string): boolean => {
  // Exact match
  if (sourceType === targetType) return true;
  
  // Flexible matching for common patterns
  if (sourceType === 'path' && (targetType === 'string' || targetType === 'glob_pattern')) return true;
  if (targetType === 'path' && (sourceType === 'string' || sourceType === 'glob_pattern')) return true;
  if (sourceType === 'glob_pattern' && targetType === 'string') return true;
  
  return false;
};
```

### Socket Color Function
```typescript
const getSocketColor = (socket: Socket, isOutput: boolean): string => {
  const connectedEdge = edges.find(/* find connected edge */);
  if (!connectedEdge) return '#999'; // Gray
  
  const connectedSocket = /* find connected socket */;
  const typesMatch = areTypesCompatible(socket.type, connectedSocket.type);
  
  return typesMatch ? '#4CAF50' : '#f48771'; // Green or Red
};
```

### Delete Key Handler
```typescript
React.useEffect(() => {
  const handleKeyDown = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
    if (e.key === 'Delete' && selectedNode) {
      const target = e.target as HTMLElement;
      const isTyping = target.tagName === 'INPUT' || 
                      target.tagName === 'TEXTAREA' || 
                      target.isContentEditable;
      
      if (!isTyping) {
        e.preventDefault();
        deleteSelectedNode();
      }
    }
  };
  window.addEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('keydown', handleKeyDown);
}, [selectedNode, deleteSelectedNode]);
```

## Testing

### Build Verification âœ…
- âœ… TypeScript compilation: No errors
- âœ… Frontend build: Successful (320KB bundle)
- âœ… Wails build: Successful (executable created at `build/bin/pipeline-designer.exe`)

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Connect matching types â†’ green sockets
- [ ] Connect mismatched types â†’ red sockets
- [ ] Verify dashed red edge animation
- [ ] Hover over socket â†’ see type tooltip
- [ ] Select node, press Delete â†’ node removed
- [ ] Type in input field, press Delete â†’ character removed (not node)
- [ ] Press Ctrl+Z after deletion â†’ node restored
- [ ] Delete node with connections â†’ all connections removed

## Performance Impact

- **Socket coloring**: O(E) where E = number of edges (minimal)
- **Delete handler**: Single event listener (no polling)
- **Type checking**: Only on connection creation
- **Zero impact** on pipeline execution time

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… **Fully backward compatible**:
- Existing pipelines load without modification
- YAML format unchanged
- CLI definitions unchanged
- No breaking changes to any APIs

## Screenshots

See `VISUAL_EXAMPLES.md` for ASCII diagrams showing:
- Valid connections (green sockets)
- Invalid connections (red sockets with dashed lines)
- Delete key workflow
- Type compatibility matrix

## User Impact

### Benefits
1. **Early error detection**: Catch type mismatches before running pipeline
2. **Visual feedback**: Immediate understanding of connection validity
3. **Faster workflow**: Delete nodes without reaching for the mouse
4. **Safer editing**: Delete key won't interfere with text input

### No Disruption
- Non-breaking changes
- Familiar patterns (Delete key is standard in node editors)
- Graceful degradation (works without types in CLI definitions)

## How to Test

1. **Build and run**:
   ```bash
   cd pipeline-designer
   wails build
   ./build/bin/pipeline-designer.exe
   ```

2. **Test type validation**:
   - Add a "Convert to TIF" node
   - Add a "Merge Channels" node
   - Connect TIF files output to input-files input
   - Verify sockets turn green
   - Try connecting to an incompatible input
   - Verify sockets turn red and edge is dashed

3. **Test delete key**:
   - Select a node
   - Press Delete â†’ node should be removed
   - Add a node, select it
   - Click in an input field, type some text
   - Press Delete â†’ should remove character, not node
   - Select node again (outside input)
   - Press Delete â†’ node should be removed
   - Press Ctrl+Z â†’ node should be restored

## Code Review Focus Areas

1. **Type checking logic**: Is the compatibility function comprehensive?
2. **Edge cases**: What happens with unusual type combinations?
3. **Performance**: Any concerns with O(E) socket color calculation?
4. **UX**: Is the visual feedback clear and obvious?
5. **Safety**: Can the Delete key accidentally remove nodes?

## Deployment Notes

- No database migrations required
- No environment variables needed
- No configuration changes needed
- Users will see new features immediately after update
