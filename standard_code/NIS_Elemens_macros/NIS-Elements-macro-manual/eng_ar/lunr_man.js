     content: "       Typically, a laboratory computer image analysis system consists of a computer, a camera, and a microscope equipped with certain accessories (objectives, filters, shutters, illumination, rotary changers, etc). Most of the mentioned microscopic hardware can be motorized and therefore can be controlled via NIS-Elements. In addition, it is possible to integrate single settings of all these devices into one compact set called Optical Configuration. It is recommended to create several optical configurations containing particular devices settings. Then a single click can completely change the current hardware configuration. Please check that all the devices (microscopes, cameras, etc.) which you want to associate with the new optical configuration are properly attached to the system and working.Choose the    command. In the window which appears, adjust the settings of the devices to match the intended state which will be saved to the optical configuration. Figure&nbsp;51.&nbsp;Type the name of the new optical configuration to the Name field. Use a short descriptive name, the name is used on the button in the main toolbar when you select the Show on toolbar option.In the left column, select which device settings to associate with the Optical configuration. Only the devices related to the currently selected light path are listed here.Camera setting A list of the current camera properties appears on the right. It is being updated dynamically.Use Stored ROI If you want to include the camera ROI settings, select this option. Status of the camera ROI (ON/OFF) and its size will be set when switching to this configuration.Channel setup These settings determine how channels of newly captured images will be named and what color will be assigned to them. The available properties depends on the current camera setup (color/mono, triggered acquisition engaged or not, dual view engaged or not, etc.). In the mono camera mode, you can either assign the name, the emission length and color to the channel Manually, or leave this task to NIS-Elements (the Automatically option). In such case, information of the light path (emission wavelength) will be used to determine the channel name and color.Microscope setting If there is more than one shutter available and you would like to associate a shutter with the optical configuration, select which one is the Active Shutter from the pull-down menu. Select which parts of the microscope shall be included in the configuration by checking them in the Used devices dialog box. Active shutters remember their aperture setting and display it in the Microscope setting section.Objective An objective mounted to a motorized nosepiece can be included in the configuration. Select the objective from the pull-down menu. Objectives which are currently assigned to any position of the nosepiece are listed. See  . The objective must be assigned to a nosepiece position via the microscope control pad or the nosepiece control panel beforehand.If some of the device settings still need to be adjusted, click the Camera &amp; Devices Controls button and select the appropriate control panel from the pull-down menu. Adjust the settings within the control panel, the optical configuration will be updated automatically.Click Finish to save the new optical configuration and to close the window.You can create more optical configurations by repeating the procedure. The optical configurations are saved to registry immediately. A backup of the optical configurations can be made by running the    command and clicking the Export button. To display the optical configurations manager window, run the    command. You can make the following actions from the window:Create, duplicate, rename, delete, copy settings and switch between optical configurations.Modify optical configuration properties.Import and export optical configurations to/from an XML file. Once created, the configuration appears in the list and can be shared with other users by changing the Private option to Shared (see  ). The following operations can be performed on the selected configuration:It can be deleted by pressing the Remove button. A confirmation dialog box appears.Its name can be changed by the Rename button. A button with the configuration name appears in the toolbar (if the Show on toolbar option is selected).The configuration settings may be transferred to another optical configuration by the Copy to button. Press the button and select the optical configuration to be overwritten with the current one.A copy of the configuration can be made via the Duplicate button.The configuration can be applied to by the Set As Active button.The settings of all optical configurations can be exported to an external XML file using the Export button.The previously exported optical configurations settings can be loaded from the XML file via the Import button.The list of optical configurations can be ordered manually using the arrow-up and arrow-down buttons.Each configuration can be arbitrarily modified within the right-side portion of the window.The optical configuration buttons become available in the main toolbar if the Show on toolbar option was selected during the setting process. You can use one   when working with live image and switch to another optical configuration just for the image acquisition, very often, this is performed automatically. However, if the optical configuration used for acquisition has the Auto Exposure camera mode turned on, it may produce over-saturated or under-saturated images.Since the Auto Exposure algorithm estimates the optimal exposure time by analyzing several last frames, it cannot make the estimation correctly if the change of optical configurations would cause significant change in image brightness. To prevent this, we recommend to use a manual exposure mode in the optical configuration used for capturing. ",

If no suitable configuration exists, you can create a new one by selecting the &lt;define new...&gt; option from the pull-down menu in the Optical Configuration column. When the light path is switched, the current settings before the switch are stored and are set again when the user returns to the original light path. The Last Used option for Multichannel experiments means that it will use these saved light path settings. So, if you use this option for the EPI light path, it will use the current settings if the system is now on the EPI light path. If you use this option for the EPI light path but the system is, for example, on the DIA light path, then it will use the saved EPI light path settings from before the switch.The Comp.

Camera When you are in a multi camera mode, you can select the camera to capture each channel.T pos. If there are T dimensions engaged in the experiment, another column called T Phase appears in the table. You can reduce the number of captured channels by selecting First or every n-th (the channel is included in the first or every n-th time phase only).Z Pos. If there is a Z dimension engaged in the experiment, another column called Z Pos. appears in the table. You can reduce the number of captured channels by selecting the Home option - the channel will be captured within the home position of each Z series only. Also, if a TIRF system is available, the TIRF option appears as an option. If selected, the channel will be captured within the TIRF position of each Z series only (the TIRF position can be set within the Z-Series acquisition setup window). The settings of the T phase and Z Pos. columns can be combined in any way, but at least one channel must be included in every T or Z loop. In other words, the All option must be selected at least once in each of the columns.Merge Cameras Available only in multi camera mode. When using two cameras, two ND2 files will be created by default. If the Merge Cameras option is selected, only one ND2 file is created. This ND2 file contains the maximum parameters from the two cameras (width, height and bit depth per component).Stretch Camera images to Same Size Available only for multi camera mode.

     content: "     NIS-Elements being a multi-purpose imaging system can be used as a handy tool to study objects, live organisms, processes, etc. The universal ND2 (N-dimensional) file format is what makes this possible. One ND2 file can contain multiple images organized according to what type of acquisition they came from. There are the following acquisition types: Each acquisition type gives a name to the corresponding dimension of the resulting ND2 file. For example, we can speak about two-dimensional TZ ND2 file, which means the file contains the Time-lapse dimension and the Z-series dimension.Time-lapse - T A sequence of images can be captured over a period of time and create a time-lapse image. See  .Multi-point - XY Images from different coordinates of the XY stage can be acquired. See  .Z-series - Z Several techniques utilize Z-stacks of images. Such Z-stack can be for example converted to a 3D model of the specimen. See  .Multi-channel - λ Fluorescence signals can be captured selectively using excitation an emission filters, each of them creating a different color channel. See  .Large image - M (requires:  ) When the area of interest exceeds the camera field of view, you can capture a large image composed of multiple image frames and let it be stitched by an automatic algorithm.

Move your object into the center of your field of view. Adjust your camera and illumination setting to highlight the object. High contrast and low noise image bring the best results. Now you can run the ND Acquisition. The stage is automatically moved in between capturing frames so that the object of interest is always centered. When performing fast Time-lapse acquisition (capturing images in short intervals), it is important to understand how the acquisition with digital camera works. Case #1: No delay If the interval in the experiment is set to No delay, the camera runs in “internal hardware trigger mode” (i.e.: Timed mode, Streaming mode). The camera sends maximum frames to the computer. This may result in a situation where the computer is not capable of receiving all the frames the camera sends. If so, depending on the camera type, the overflowing frames may be omitted.Case #2: Interval is too short The time needed to receive one frame consists of three phases: exposure time, readout time and software overhead delay.  Figure&nbsp;258.&nbsp; Legend:exposure timereadout timecamera sends data to PCsoftware overhead timespecified intervalresulting intervalThe camera runs in a “software triggered mode” where it gives the frames much slower than in No delay because it is being synchronized with other events. In this case it is synchronized with timing of the time-lapse acquisition. If the interval between frames is set to a shorter time than is the sum of the three phases (e.g. 50 msec), some latency will occur. As a result, the interval in the image sequence is prolonged to (exposure time + readout time + SW overhead).Case#3: Interval is sufficient The camera runs in a “software triggered mode”. If the interval is sufficient, the timing in the resulting image sequence will equal the timing specified within the acquisition window.

     content: "        The following image layers can be saved within a NIS-Elements image. Figure&nbsp;292.&nbsp;Annotation layer In this layer, vector objects are stored. The results of manual and automatic measurements, text labels and other annotations can be included.Binary layer(s) The binary layer is usually the result of  . By segmentation, you distinguish objects of interest from background. A picture of night sky can make a nice example - shining stars may be “thresholded” and compose a binary layer. Then, by means of automatic measurement, you can count them. More than one binary layer can be placed over one image. See  . ROI layer ROIs (regions of interest) is a strong tool for distinguishing objects from background similar to the binary layer. The advantage over the binary layer is that ROIs are vector objects and therefore provide different way of manipulation. See  .Color layer The color layer contains the image data captured by a camera. It can handle images with the depth of up to 16 bits per color component. The dimensions of this layer determines the dimensions of the other layers. When saving an image, only some file formats are capable of saving all the layers. The other image formats will save the content of the color layer only. See  . RGB Images&nbsp;Images acquired by a color camera typically consist of three components that represent red, green and blue channel intensities. You can display a single color channel using the tabs located in the bottom-left corner of the image window. Or, an arbitrary combination of them can be selected while holding the Ctrl key down. Figure&nbsp;293.&nbsp;Multi-channel Images&nbsp;These documents usually arise from fluorescence microscopy. Instead of 3 color components (RGB), multichannel images can be composed of arbitrary number of user-definable color channels. If an image contains more than 8 components, the tabs in the bottom left corner of the image are replaced by the wavelength dimension, similarly to how other dimension loops of ND2 files are displayed.Click the   Treat As Spectral button in the top image toolbar to use the current image as a spectral image revealing more channel switching features in the bottom control bar. Figure&nbsp;294.&nbsp;ALL Selects the full spectrum of the image including spectral (FLUO) and transmitted detector (TD) channels.FLUO Selects only spectral channels. This button is useful for quick switching between FLUO and TD.TD Displays only the transmitted detector (TD) image.CUST. This button displays custom channels. To set a channel (multiple channels) as custom, make a channel selection in the control bar, right-click over the selection and choose Set selected channels as Custom.Alternatively switch to the   Split Components view, select multiple channel thumbnails and choose Set selected channels as Custom from the context menu over the image. Then select Show Thumbnail of Merged All Channels to include the All channels thumbnail or Show Thumbnail of Merged Custom Channels to include the Custom channel thumbnail.Equation Channel Images&nbsp;(requires:  )When processing image channels using custom equations (   or   ), new Equation channels are created. These channels represent a combination of the source image channels and mathematical functions. A real image channel can be created from an equation channel after secondary-mouse clicking on the Equation channel tab and selecting Convert Equation to Mono Channel or Convert Equation to Floating Point Channel. The equation channel can also be exported to an RGB image (Extract as RGB Snapshot) or as a floating point image (Extract as Floating Point Image).ND2 (multi-dimensional) files / datasets&nbsp;An ND2 file is usually a sequence of images. One ND2 file can contain multiple images organized according to what type of acquisition they came from. There are the following acquisition types, also called dimensions available: Time-lapse, Multi-point, Z-series, Multi-channel, Large-image. The dimensions can be combined together.Please see  ,  . Single channels and monochromatic images can be visualized using a predefined color scale. Right-click the “channel tab” in the bottom left corner of the image window and select a color scale from the     Channel Coloring... sub-menu. Figure&nbsp;295.&nbsp;Brightfield and Fluorescence channel image&nbsp;If your ND2 image contains only one Brightfield channel with its Modality set to Brightfield in Channel Properties, the behavior of viewing colors of these channels slightly changes. The Brightfield channel is set to Mono color by default but can be switched to any other pseudocolor. The fluorescence channels are displayed in their native fluorescence color by default and can by switched to any other pseudocolor. Once the Brightfield and fluorescence channels are displayed together in an overlay, the pseudocolor of the fluorescence channel is ignored and is shown in its true color. Despite the color in which a channel is displayed, other per-channel colors can be assigned to it. This regards colors for:indication of oversaturated pixelsindication of undersaturated pixelsindication of binary pixelsIn the context menu over a channel, select    and choose a color for oversaturated pixels, undersaturated pixels (these colors are used globally for all images in NIS-Elements until next change) and for binary pixels.

ND2 filesDrag one of the channel tabs and drop it by the primary mouse button. It behaves the same way as if performed on a single image.Drag one of the channel tabs by the secondary mouse button and drop it to the application screen. A context menu appears that enables you to select whether to create the new image from all frames or just a single frame.Two ND2 files that have matching structure can be merged into one easily. E.g. two single channel Z stacks with the same number of Z positions can be merged into a single two component ND2 Z-stack by dragging one into the other.Drag one of the channel tabs of a single image and drop it to an ND2 file. The channel will be copied to every loop of the ND2 file. This behavior, too, takes place when copying channels that do not have matching structure (just the current frame is copied to every position of the target ND2). The currently selected channel(s) can be shifted using the CTRL + SHIFT + Arrow keys. All channels are visible during the operation so you can see the complete image.The procedure also works on ND2 files equally to other image processing performed on ND2 files:Select the image frame and the channels to be shifted.Perform the shift using Ctrl+Shift+Arrows keys.A standard ND2 image processing window appears (see  ).Select which part of the ND2 file to apply the shift to, and confirm it by OK.

You can use LUTs to enhance images for observation purposes so the color modifications will be non-destructive to the image data. LUTs settings are saved along with the image file. If required, the LUTs settings can be applied to the image data by pressing the  button. Use the  Show LUTs window button in the image toolbar to display the LUTs window.The following actions are available within the LUTs window:Adjusting the Gamma parameter. The gamma curve is drawn in gray over each graph. You can drag the middle point and move it up or down, or enter an exact value to the G: field at the top of the graph area.Adjusting the input intensity range. The input intensity range can be restricted by moving the black and white triangular sliders to the center. All pixels with values outside of the modified input range will be set to maximum/minimum values and the remaining pixels will be approximated in order to fill the output (full) range. This is the way how images can be equalized. For example, if the image is very dark and most of the histogram is located to the left while the right part of it is flat, you may move the white slider(s) to the position where the histogram line starts to rise. This will incredibly brighten the image and reveal details which were previously hidden in a dark.You can adjust the histograms height non-proportionally by moving the slider on the left side of the window up and down.TipsRight-click the graph area and (de)select Draw trend style.

Pixel saturation indication Switch this button ON and the system highlights all pixels with values reaching maximal values. Select colors to highlight the pixels with in the pull-down menu. See also  .  These buttons arrange histograms of single channels next to each other horizontally or vertically. This button arranges histograms of single channels overlapped. Use sliders at the bottom of the graph window to amplify or reduce the green/red/blue component display in the view. Save/Load LUTs This pull-down menu enables user to handle LUTs settings in various ways. They can be saved to a *.lut file and loaded later. Or, LUTs settings saved along with an image can be loaded directly from this image by the Reuse LUTs from File command. Or you can copy/paste the settings within the documents opened in NIS-Elements.Modify Image Through LUTs Press this  button to apply the LUTs settings to the image data - the original image will be overwritten. Until you press this button, no changes are made to the image data. Reset Zoom Zooms the histogram to fit the preview window. Auto Range Zooms the histogram so that the “high” and “low” limits are distinguishable. For example, if a small intensity range is defined on a 16bit image the low and high lines are displayed as one-pixel line. Pressing this button will stretch the histogram in order to display the lines separately. Press the arrow next to the Reset LUTs button and a pull-down menu appears. Invoke the Settings command. Figure&nbsp;331.&nbsp;The Low and High fields determine how many of all pixels of the picture are left outside the sliders when Auto Scale is applied (0-10%). White color in some images may suffer from having a color tint. The AWB (Auto White Balance) mode adjusts the image to get pure white instead of this tint. Similarly to LUTs auto scale, the AWB function can be used once, or permanently on the live image. If you know the tint your “white” color has, you can select this color by the color picker that appears after pressing the ... button: Figure&nbsp;332.&nbsp;Choose the color by mouse. You can also enter the RGB values to the fields below. A preview of the chosen color appears in the rightmost rectangle. All features mentioned above are also valid for monochromatic images, except that the AWB function is not available. There are some other features added when in “mono” mode.Gradient Mapping monochromatic images to pseudo-color gradients is often used to enhance details in the image which would otherwise not be obvious. This button indicates the currently selected gradient. When pressed, a pull-down menu appears where you can select the color scheme you would like to use. Try a few of the schemes to see which one suits best. Figure&nbsp;333.&nbsp;Manage Custom LUTs The Manage Custom LUTs command in the pull down menu defines a custom LUTs gradient. Use the tools available in the dialog window to define your custom gradients. They then appear in the pull down menu ready to be applied. Please see    for details about the custom LUTs definition.  Figure&nbsp;334.&nbsp;LUTs window on two-channel imageMost of features mentioned above are also valid for multi-channel images. There are some other features added when in “multi-channel” mode. Each channel is controlled separately by default. To control all channels at the same time, press and hold the Shift key while you drag the sliders or adjust Gamma.When the image contains up to three channels, all channels can be visible at the same time and you can handle them similarly to the RGB mode. When there are more than three channels, only one channel is displayed at a time. A pull-down menu in the toolbar enables you to select the channel to be displayed.Next to the channel selection pull-down menu, there is this   Auto Scale button. By pressing it, the system will automatically adjust only the current channel settings. When observing a spectral image, the graph inside the LUTs window does not show the image histogram(s), but reveals another information about the image. Intensity values are on the Y axis and spectra is on the X. There are two curves in the graph. The top (white) curve displays the maximal intensity and the color curve displays the mean intensity of each channel. Spectral image consists of many channels, each representing a single wavelength.The LUTs behavior depends on the selected displaying mode. There are four displaying modes. You can select the mode either by a pull-down menu in the LUTs toolbar, or within the image top toolbar.True ColorCustom ColorGroupedGray ScaleIn the bottom part of the LUTs window, Brightness and Black Level settings can be adjusted either for all channels together or for each group separately - depending on the displaying mode. The Brightness and Black Level sliders offer a range of values to be set by moving them, but any higher value can be entered in the field next of the sliders.TD channel&nbsp;A spectral image can contain additional TD (transmitted detector) channel. Its basically a standard monochromatic image. LUTs settings of this channel appear on the right edge of the LUTs window. True Color Displaying Mode&nbsp;You can switch to this displaying mode by clicking the  button located in the image toolbar. Figure&nbsp;335.&nbsp; Custom Color Displaying Mode&nbsp;You can switch to this displaying mode by clicking the  button located in the image toolbar. You can assign custom colors to sections of the spectrum. Sections (colors) can be added/removed by clicking the + and - buttons placed below the spectral graph. To change the section color, click the button located in the color stripe. A window appears where you can select the color from a palette or define it by Hue or Wavelength settings. Figure&nbsp;336.&nbsp; Grouped Displaying Mode&nbsp;You can switch to this displaying mode by clicking the  button located in the image toolbar. This view enables you to reduce the number of channels multiple-times. You can adjust the number of groups by the + and - buttons and also change each channel width by moving the white horizontal dividers. Brightness and Black Level for each group can be adjusted. Figure&nbsp;337.&nbsp; Gray Scale Displaying Mode&nbsp;You can switch to this displaying mode by clicking the  button located in the image toolbar. The image is displayed in gray scale, but various color gradients can be applied to it. Figure&nbsp;338.&nbsp; ",

   { title: "Macro Language Syntax",
     xmlid: "id|GS_MacroLanguageDefinitionx",
     content: "          Specifies the NIS-Elements Macro Language features. The following data types are implemented:char textchar8 &lt;-128, +127&gt;byte &lt;0, +255&gt;int &lt;-32.768, +32.767&gt;int64 &lt;-9.223.372.036.854.775.808, +9.223.372.036.854.775.807&gt;word &lt;0, +65.535&gt;long &lt;-2.147.483.648, +2.147.483.647&gt;dword &lt;0, +4.294.967.295&gt;double &lt;1.7E +/- 308 (15 digits)&gt; Structures and unions are not supported. One and two dimensional arrays are supported. You should declare local variables at the beginning of macro or function only. You should declare global variables only at the beginning of macro. You can run two nested macros declaring the same global variables, but they must be of the same type. You can declare global variables by prefixing the declaration global. Eg.:global int Number_Rows;\nglobal char buffer[200];\nThe “global” keyword in front of the variable definition assigns the variable to the global scope. Such variable is then accessible from all function scopes within the macro interpreter. Supported Statementsfor The for statement lets you repeat a statement a specified number of times.Syntax\n\nfor([init-expr]; [cond-expr]; [loop-expr])\n         statement\nFirst, the initialization (init-expr) is evaluated. Then, while the conditional expression (cond-expr) evaluates to a non zero value, Statement is executed and the loop expression (loop-expr) is evaluated. When cond-expr becomes 0, control passes to the statement the following the for loop.while The while statement lets you repeat a statement until a specified expression becomes false.Syntax\n\nwhile(expression) statement\nFirst, the expression is evaluated. If expression is initially false, the body of the while statement is never executed, and control passes from the while statement to the next statement in the program. If expression is true (nonzero), the body of the statement is executed and the process is repeated.if, else Conditionally executes a statement or group of statements, depending on the value of an expression.Syntax\nif(expression) statement1 \n    [else statement2]\nThe if keyword executes statement1 if expression is true (nonzero). If the else keyword is present and expression is false (zero), it executes statement2. After executing statement1 or statement2, control passes to the next statement.goto Transfers control of the program execution.Syntax\n\ngoto name; \n     . . . \n    name: statement\nYou cannot use goto to jump inside the block from outside. E.g. following is not allowed:goto label; \n    if(k&gt;5) \n      { \n    label: \n       DilateBinary(3, 5); \n       FillHoles(); \n       }\nYou cannot use goto to jump out from the block more then 2 block levels down. E.g. the following is not allowed:for(i=0; i&lt;64; i=i+1) \n       { \n       for(j=0; j&lt;64; j=j+1) \n          { \n          if(a[i] &gt; b[i]) \n             { \n             value = i; \n             goto end;  // crossing 3 right brackets \n             } \n           } \n        } \n    end\nbreak Terminates the execution of the nearest enclosing statement.Syntax\n\nbreak;\nThe break keyword terminates the execution of the smallest enclosing for or while statement in which it appears. Control passes to the statement that follows the terminated statement.continue Passes control to the next iteration of the statement in which it appears.Syntax\ncontinue;\nThe continue keyword passes control to the next iteration of the for or while statement in which it appears. Within a while statement, the next iteration starts by reevaluating the expression of the while statement. Within a for statement, the first expression of the for statement is evaluated. Then the compiler reevaluates the conditional expression and, depending on the result, either terminates or iterates the statement body.Statements which are not supporteddo, switch, case, default, typedef These statements are not supported. The following directives are supported by the system:define The #define directive assigns a meaningful name to a constant in a program.//Syntax\n\n    #define identifier token-string\nThe directive substitutes token-string for all subsequent occurrences of the identifier in the source file. Token-string can be a value or a string (only for 32-bit version of NIS-Elements).//Example\n\n    #define ERROR_SPRINTF 0\n    #define MAINDIR \"c:\\Images\"\n\n    int main()\n    {\n    char buf[256];\n    int retval; \n\n    retval = sprintf(buf, \"%s\", \"MAINDIR\");\n    if(retval == ERROR_SPRINTF)\n    Beep();\n    else WaitText(0., buf);\n    return TRUE;\n    }  include Specifies the name of the file to be included.//Syntax\n\n    #include filenameThe #include directive includes the contents a file with a specified filename in the source program at the point where the directive appears.Example\n    // if you do  not specify the full path, NIS-Elements assumes, that it is a relative path to a main directory\n\n    #include \"macros\\my_macro.h\"\n    #include \"c:\\NIS-Elements\\macros\\my_macro1.h\"\nimport The #import directive is used to incorporate information from an external library.//Syntax\n\n    #import(\"DLLname\"); \n    #import function_declaration\nNIS-Elements can call functions from external DLL's. You should import the DLL, where the functions resides and then make a declaration of the functions. You should not import the following system DLL's: kernel32.dll, user32.dll, gdi32.dll, com32.dll, comdlg32.dll. This feature is available only for 32 bit version of NIS-Elements.//Example\n\n    #import(\"luc_13.dll\");\n    #import int RTF_ReplaceVariables(LPSTR destfile, LPSTR sourfile); \n    #import int RTF_FindQuestion(LPSTR sourfile, LPSTR question, long *length, LPSTR defvar);\n    #import int RTF_ReplaceQuestion(LPSTR destfile, LPSTR sourfile, LPSTR replacement);\n__underC The __underC directive assigns a function to be interpreted by the UnderC engine instead of the standard interpreter.//Syntax\n//works only on 32bit operating systems\n\n__underC int inter_sharpen(int cols, int rows) { }#importUC The #importUC directive imports an API function to the UnderC engine so that it can be used from within there.//Syntax\n//works only on 32bit operating systems\n\n#importUC DisplayCurrentPicture; Example&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Usage of #importUC / __underC#importUC DisplayCurrentPicture;\n\nint main()\n   {\n   int rows, cols;\n\n   AddUndoImage();\n\n   rows = 256;\n   cols = 256;\n\n   SetCommandText(\"Working...\");\n   Get_Size(SIZE_PICTURE,NULL,NULL,&amp;cols,&amp;rows);\n\n   //Enable_Interrupt_InScript(0);\n   Enable_Interrupt_InScript(2);\n\n   inter_sharpen(cols, rows);\n   DisplayCurrentPicture();\n   }\n\n__underC int inter_sharpen(int cols, int rows)\n   {\n   int i, j, value;\n   for(i=0; i&lt;rows; ++i)\n  {\n  for(j=0; j&lt;cols; ++j)\n     {\n     value = 5 * GetPixelValue(-1,i,j,0);\n     value = value - GetPixelValue(-1, i-1,j, 0);\n     value = value - GetPixelValue(-1, i+1,j, 0);\n     value = value - GetPixelValue(-1, i,j+1, 0);\n     value = value - GetPixelValue(-1, i,j-1, 0);\n     if(value &lt;0) value=0;\n     if(value &gt;255) value=255;\n     SetPixelValue(0,value,i,j,0);\n     }\n  if(0 == i % 20)\n     DisplayCurrentPicture();\n  }\n   }\n The following operators are supported by the system.  Precedence of operators in NIS-Elements is different than might be expected. See  . arithmetic operators+ Addition- Subtraction* Multiplication/ Division% Modulo assignment operatorsThe assignment operator assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.= Addition bitwise operatorsThe bitwise operators compare each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. The following bitwise operators are supported.&amp; Bitwise AND| Bitwise OR~ One's complement pointer operators&amp; Address of ?* Indirection relational operators&lt; Less than&lt;= Less than or equal to&gt; Greater than&gt;= Greater than or equal== Equal!= Not equal logical operatorsThe logical operators perform logical operations on expressions. The following logical operators are supported:&amp;&amp; Logical AND|| Logical OR! Logical NOT  Precedence of operators in NIS-Elements is different than might be expected. See  . If an expression contains more than one operator:Logical operators are evaluated from right to left!!!It is recommended to always use brackets to define different evaluation order:if( !a &amp;&amp; !b )is evaluated by NIS-Elements as!( a &amp;&amp; !(b) )To make it work as expected it should be written as:if( (!a) &amp;&amp; (!b) )Priority of arithmetic operators is standard, division (/), multiplication (*) and modulo (%) have higher priority then other operators. The system can interpret your own C-like functions. An entry point to program is the main() function in your macro. If main() is not presented, for backward compatibility, the body of the macro is also considered as \"main function\". The new macros should use main() as an entry point.The general C-like functions (also called interpreted functions, as opposed to basic system functions from NIS-Elements) have the following syntax. Syntax\n\n    int MyFunction(int a, LPSTR str, double d) \n    { \n    int retval; \n    . . . \n    return retval; \n    }\n Return Value The return value can be any basic data types (char, int, word, dword, int, double or pointer).Parameters Parameters can be any basic data types (char int, word, dword, int, double or pointer). Int and double parameters are automatically converted to string type, when they are assigned to text variable, or are one of the parameters of a function.Example\n    int main()\n    {\n    char buf[256];\n    my_function1(buf);\n    WaitText(0., buf);\n    return TRUE;\n    }\n\n    int my_function1(char *buf)\n    {\n    strcpy(buf, \"This function has a pointer to char array as a parameter\");\n    return TRUE;\n}\n ",

     content: " Automated measurement is the most powerful of image analysis features. In combination with user macros, NIS-Elements can become a semi- or fully-automatic image analysis tool. There are several key procedures which a proper automated measurement should involve:Optical system calibration (see the   chapter)Image acquisition (see the   chapter)Defining threshold, creating the binary layer (see the   chapter)Performing the automated measurementResults presentationImage Layers Involved in MeasurementThe binary layer and also the color image can get involved in the automated measurement:Binary layer - is typically used for shape and size measurements (area, perimeter, etc).Color layer - intensity or hue measurements are carried out on this layer. The area covered with the binary layer is used as the source data.Object/Field MeasurementNIS-Elements distinguishes two types of automated measurements: object and field.Object Measurement Groups of neighboring pixels of the binary layer are called objects. Results of the object measurement are usually the object data such as Length, Area, CentreX/Y (the X,Y position of the central pixel of an object), etc.Field Measurement Field measurements produce information regarding the whole measurement area (measurement frame, ROI). Such information can be Area Fraction, Mean Brightness, Density Variation, etc.Please see the complete list of measurement features in the   chapter.Restricting the Area of MeasurementThe area of measurement can be restricted by the measurement frame or by a user defined region of interest (ROI).Region of Interest - ROI ROI is a user defined area of the image. Whenever the ROI is displayed (by the    command), it is also applied to restrict the area of measurement.See also  .Measurement Frame The measurement frame is a re-sizable rectangular frame which serves for bounding the area accepted for measurement. Turn the measurement frame ON via the    command.Binary objects touching edges of ROI or the measurement frame can be treated differently (excluded from the measurement or included). This behavior can be specified within the    window.Statistics and Data Presentation&nbsp;NIS-Elements calculates basic statistics - mean value, standard deviation and distribution of all measured features. The features to be measured can be selected in the    and the    windows. Results of all automated measurements are presented and can be exported from the    control panel. ",

The time line gets highlighted with red color.Click to the time line where a certain position of the object shall occur.Move the object by mouse or adjust it in some way (zoom, crop, etc.) - at this moment, the key frame will be added to the time line automatically.Click to the time line where another position shall occur, and so on...The director's mode shall be used when you know precisely how the movie shall look. A contextual menu appears whenever you right-click on any key frame or between two key frames (a segment) within the time line.Set keyframe time Sets the selected key frame position - moves the key frame to this position.Set as new start of the movie Sets the selected key frame as the first frame of the movie and moves all other key frames proportionally. Key frames prior to the selected one will be deleted.Set as new end of the movie Sets the selected key frame as a new end of the movie and moves all other key frames proportionally. Key frames past the selected one will be deleted.Copy keyframe, Paste keyframe Enables the user to copy and paste key frames.Delete keyframe Deletes the selected key frame.Delete all keyframes Deletes all defined key frames.Set time segment duration Sets the segment duration.

Set Spline for smooth changes (motion, lightness, etc.) Figure&nbsp;469.&nbsp;Interpolation TypesEase in, Ease out Easing defines the interpolation rate between two key frames. No easing means constant rate of interpolation. Use the Ease in option for the first time segment to increase slowly the rate of change. On the contrary, the Ease out option serves the best at the end of the movie to make the motion slowly stop. Of course, you can get the benefit of combining them. Figure&nbsp;470.&nbsp;Interpolation Rate Types Simple and fast way how to make a movie is to use any of the predefined presets.360º turn around X axis (in screen space) Makes movie of Volume view rotating around selected axis.Build-up in Z direction Makes movie of appearing Volume view which starts from the bottom up.Build-up in Z direction (reversed) Makes movie of appearing Volume view which starts from the top down.Time sequence Makes movie of Volume view within the Time loop.Combine presets Different presets can also be combined together.

     content: "        If you want to perform measurements on captured images it is needed to calibrate the objective used to capture images. Whenever an image is captured through a calibrated objective, the image inherits its calibration. Run the    command. The Objectives window appears: Figure&nbsp;42.&nbsp;A list of used objectives can be created within the Objectives window. For each objective, the objective name, position in the changer, storage status and the calibration are displayed. A Calculator  icon next to the calibration value indicates that the calibration has been calculated from objective properties. If the calculator icon is missing, the calibration has been performed manually. Use the buttons on the right side to manage the objectives. Edit the properties of the selected objective in the bottom part of the window.See   . Display the microscope control pad -   Click the setup  button in the  nosepiece section.A window appears which enables you to select one of the available objectives to the corresponding position.Each objective has its specifications displayed in the table. These specifications are not editable. After you press the Recalibrate button in the Objectives window or when creating a new custom objective, the following window appears: Figure&nbsp;43.&nbsp;Select one of the calibration methods:The Manual calibration lets you draw a distance into a picture and assign real length to it. The live image starts automatically and a window appears. Proceed to:  If a motorized XY stage is available, the Auto and 4 points buttons appear. Proceed to:  .Press OK to continue.Superresolution Calibration&nbsp;This type of calibration is available after successful manual or automatic calibration. It triples the camera's resolution and uses fine stage movements to improve the resulting objective calibration. Click the Run SR Calibration button and wait till the objective is calibrated. Manual calibration requires the user to specify a distance in the image. It can be either a measurable distance or the size of one pixel. The following procedure can be used for different purposes:Calibrating of an image (see  )(Re)calibrating of an objective (see  )(Re)calibrating of a microscope zoom (see  )The following window appears: Figure&nbsp;44.&nbsp;If you know the size of one pixel, click the Pixel size... button. Figure&nbsp;45.&nbsp;Enter the value and finish the calibration by the OK button.If you do not know the pixel size, you will need to specify distance in the image. For this purpose, use an image of a calibration slide or a ruler captured with your current system configuration.The distance is defined by placing lines to the image. If you are sure the calibration pattern is perpendicular to image edges, it is recommended to select either vertical  or horizontal  lines. Otherwise, select the parallel lines .Click into the image to place the first line and then the second line to specify the distance:,  You can modify the line position while holding the primary mouse button. After you release the button no further changes can be made. Place the second line in the intended position by another click. Draw the first line by clicking twice inside the image. The line can be moved and adjusted arbitrary by mouse. When satisfied, finish the first line by right-click. The second line can be placed by another click to the image, this time only to adjust the distance from the first line. The process is completed by right-click.Zoom on Click zooms the image after the mouse button is clicked so that the position of the point can be set precisely.Then the following dialog box appears: Figure&nbsp;46.&nbsp;Enter the distance between the two lines and select correct units.Click OK to finish the calibration. This procedure requires a motorized stage. Select one of the following methods:Auto The Auto method is fully automatic. Calibration is performed on a part of the live image marked by red square that is shown before the calibration is launched. You can also choose the channel to be used by auto-calibration. Figure&nbsp;47.&nbsp;Auto-calibration windowNIS-Elements moves the motorized stage, acquires two images, and calculates the calibration from the shift of the images. The auto-calibration performs an estimation of the real relay lens zoom factor. If the estimation does not match the value specified in the Device Manager window, a warning appears. Figure&nbsp;48.&nbsp;Example of the warning messageIt is recommended to cancel the auto calibration (click No), check the real zoom factor of your relay lens and set correct relay lens settings in the Device Manager. The success of this method depends on the texture of the specimen, its contrast, illumination, etc. If the combination of these factors is unsuitable, the auto calibration may fail. If it fails, try the following:Move the stage to another area of the specimen to get a better texture.Improve contrast by setting  .Check focus, re-focus if needed.Turn on the shading correction (see  ).4 points If you select the 4 points method, the system draws four points on the screen (subsequently) and asks user to move one significant part of the specimen to each position. After all four steps are completed, the calibration is calculated from the moves of the stage. A real zoom factor can be displayed within the image window. In order for the value to be accurate, both the image calibration and the monitor calibration must be accurate. To calibrate the monitor:Display a context menu over a calibrated image and select the    command. The computed value appears in the top left corner of the image. If the current image is not calibrated, the box will show N/A.Right-click the box with the zoom value and select Monitor Calibration, the following window appears. Figure&nbsp;49.&nbsp;Monitor Calibration Dialog  The dialog displays calibration of the monitor on which it is displayed. If you have multiple monitors, move the dialog between them.Check the Width and Height values and whether they match the real size of your monitor. The detected monitor type is displayed in the window. If the information about the model is precise, it is likely that the automatic calibration is correct, otherwise, we recommend to switch to Custom monitor calibration.If you are not sure whether the detected calibration is correct, select Custom monitor calibration. Take a ruler or a measuring tape and measure width and height of your monitor. Enter these values and confirm the calibration by the OK button.

This is selected by the Condition type radio button.If the field type is Text, the Occurrence setting determines the way of evaluating the expression:Anywhere - If the given sequence of characters is found anywhere in the field, the system will evaluate it as a match. For example: you have entered “set” to the Values field. The filter will select records with the following field values: “set”, “reset”, “settings”, “preset”, etc.Exact - If the given sequence of characters exactly equals to the content of the field, it is evaluated as a match. Fields containing the “set” value only will match.Start - If the entered string is found at the beginning of a field, it passes the condition. For example: fields containing “set”, “settings”, “setup” will match.All letter strings - It is possible to search for more expressions. These should be entered separated by commas.

     content: "         User management is very useful when a single workstation is shared by number of users. Some user accounts may have administrator rights to NIS-Elements while other's privileges are quite restricted. A per-person system may be established or user accounts may be shared. The following principles are utilized within NIS-Elements:MS Windows accounts support NIS-Elements can assign privileges to MS Windows accounts. Whoever is logged in the operating system and runs NIS-Elements obtains a default set of privileges. System administrator can then further restrict or extend the user's rights.NIS-Elements password protection It may be not comfortable enough to log the current user off from MS Windows when a user change is required in NIS-Elements. For such case a completely independent list of user accounts, which is not connected with MS Windows users, can be created. Then just restart of NIS-Elements is needed to switch the user.Private vs. Shared storage Every user-created item (setting) important in the work-flow can be protected from unwanted change in two levels. First, the creator of the item (optical configuration, layout, objective, etc.) can save it as private. Unless its status is changed to shared, no other user will even see this item within the lists throughout the application. The second level of protection concerning all shared items is provided by assigning users to Groups and Privileges groups.Groups Every user is a member of a group. The group enumerates shared items (Hardware Configurations, Objectives, Layouts, etc.) which will be visible for its members. NIS-Elements administrators can create any number of groups and select the items to be visible.Privileges There are basic groups of privileges which allows users or restrict them to perform certain actions. This concerns for example modifying macros, reports, selecting cameras, etc. There are four levels of privileges by default, but further can be created by an administrator:AdminCommonGuestDefault If you have chosen “ NIS-Elements (Password protected)” user authentication method, a login dialog window appears at every start-up of NIS-Elements. Enter a user name and a password for existing user account. If the option Allow Create New User on Startup is enabled, you can create a new user account without needing an administrator.

The complete list of cameras and devices supported by NIS-Elements is available in a separate document.  Figure&nbsp;52.&nbsp;Nikon DS-Fi3 panelResolutionFast (Focus), Quality (Capture)  The software provides two resolution presets. The first is used for live image and focusing and the second used for capturing. The formats then differ in image size and in frame rate (number of frames per second - fps). The higher the resolution is, the lower frame rate can be achieved. Available resolutions depend on the camera type. When switching between the formats while observing the live image, the size of the image on the screen is maintained - the zoom setting is changed instead. Only in some special cases, the behavior changes and the image size is changed instead of the zoom setting which is maintained. Normal mode offers 1440x1024 and 2880x2048 resolutions whereas Full HD mode offers 1920x1080 and 960x540.

Image quality is the priority, therefore longer exposure times are preferred. Continuous AE  When selected, the automatic exposure time is calculated continuously. If brightness of the scene changes, the exposure time is adjusted so that the live image is not over- or under- saturated. Analog Gain  Controls the Gain (Sensitivity) of the camera and strength of the camera analog signal before it is digitized. This setting affects image brightness. AE Compensation  In automatic exposure modes, the compensation affects how optimum exposure settings (Exposure time and Gain) are calculated. The Compensation value is expressed in Exposure Values (EV). Setting the compensation to + 1.0 EV makes the image twice brighter (e.g. doubles the Exposure time or Gain). Live Acceleration If the exposure time is too long, Live Acceleration helps you to make it shorter. The system automatically shortens the exposure time (so the frame rate rises), and the loss of intensity is compensated by increasing the gain (software multiplication). This procedure is not used upon Capture.ColorAuto White  This button performs an automatic white balancing. It calculates the right values and then adjusts the red, green, and blue image components in order to get a neutral white color. The Auto White gives the best results on color neutral (gray) scenes.

The system automatically shortens the exposure time (so the frame rate rises), and the loss of intensity is compensated by increasing the gain (software multiplication). This procedure is not used upon Capture.Image Settings  Sharpness  Some camera settings provide the sharpness control which affects how sharp edges in the image appear. Too much sharpness leads to over-saturated edges. Offset  Sets the brightness of the image. It is a constant additive (positive or negative) changing all pixel values of the image. With negative offset value the dark image areas become pure black. Considering fluorescence microscopy, an appropriate offset setting can create continuous black background and thus help to enhance (together with gain or illumination enhancement) the contrast. Saturation  The amount of saturation determines how colors are rendered. More saturation produces richer colors. Less saturation makes the colors gray. Hue  Hue shifts image colors across the rainbow.White Balance There are Red and Blue (R/B) gain properties that control how colors are rendered. It is used to eliminate a color cast from white areas.

The position of this automatic ROI can be adjusted in the    window. Depending on the actual system configuration, some of the buttons may be hidden. Format For Live, Format For Capture  The software provides two resolution presets. The first is used for live image and focusing and the second used for capturing. The formats then differ in image size and in frame rate (number of frames per second - fps). The higher the resolution is, the lower frame rate can be achieved. Available resolutions depend on the camera type. When switching between the formats while observing the live image, the size of the image on the screen is maintained - the zoom setting is changed instead. Only in some special cases, the behavior changes and the image size is changed instead of the zoom setting which is maintained. The binning mode provides considerably enhanced camera chip sensitivity by integrating more elements (pixels) together. E.g.: binning 4x4 integrates the signal from the area of 4x4 chip elements to one pixel of the resulting image. Smaller resolutions and faster frame rates are achieved using the binning modes.Auto Exposure  Automatically calculates the exposure time in order to achieve optimal brightness of the scene. Image quality is the priority, therefore longer exposure times are preferred.Readout Mode  Within this option you can select a combination of these parameters - readout speed and bit depth. The settings influences frame rate and image quality. Higher frequencies increase frame rate, lower frequencies offer better image quality.Readout modes having the EM Gain prefix engage the EM Gain Multiplier. Other modes ignore it. Conversion Gain This is a hardware pre-amplifier gain. EM Gain Multiplier  EM gain allows weak signals to be multiplied before any readout noise is added by the output amplifier, hence rendering the read noise negligible. There is a complex relationship (approximated to an exponential) between the value set and the actual level of multiplication. Typically, optimal signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range is achieved between x1 to x300 EM Gain. When the setting exceeds the value of 300, the field gets highlighted red in order to notify you. Full Sensor, Custom, Optimal These buttons change camera ROI size.Full Sensor (requires:  )Sets the ROI to cover the maximum camera resolution.Custom Sets the ROI to a custom value. Use the Define ROI command in the pull-down menu to set the size manually.Optimal Sets the ROI to a computed size which ensures that no shading is visible on the image edges. The position of this automatic ROI can be adjusted in the    window. Depending on the actual system configuration, some of the buttons may be hidden.Commands &gt; Advanced Setup Live Acceleration If the exposure time is too long, Live Acceleration helps you to make it shorter. The system automatically shortens the exposure time (so the frame rate rises), and the loss of intensity is compensated by increasing the gain (software multiplication). This procedure is not used upon Capture. Target Maximum Intensity  Restricts the maximum of image intensity after the auto exposure was applied. The value represents a percentage of the whole camera dynamic range. Maximum Exposure  This is a safeguard of the time of the Auto Exposure. For quick exposure, it is convenient not to set this value too high. Overillumination Tolerance  Sets how many pixels should be white after the Auto exposure is performed. Use lower values (0.01%) for very bright (shining) objects (fluorescence). For common bright field, even 1% may be a good value. Commands &gt; Advanced Camera Settings Trigger Mode Sets the exposure method.Internal The exposure time and the beginning of each frame acquisition is controlled by the software.Strobe In this mode, the beginning of each frame exposure is being controlled by external signal.Bulb The exposure time and frames timing are controlled by external signal connected to the camera.Triggered by master camera Having a dual camera system (or a special triggering device connected to the camera), you can use this mode. If the cameras Interval setting is set to No delay within the experiment or if the Live mode is run, the slave camera will be triggered only once so that both cameras will run simultaneously while single frames will not be synchronized. For all other settings, the trigger will be engaged once and all the subsequent frames will be controlled by the software as in the Internal mode. Desired Temperature Sets the target temperature of the CCD chip.Sensor Mode  This option sets the method of reading the CCD chip. Automatic This option makes the system to choose the best mode. Normal A standard mode where the exposure phase is followed by the readout phase. Please, see the camera user manual for further details. Frame Transfer This mode enables the camera to achieve higher frame rates by reducing the exposure+readout time (the readout is performed simultaneously with the exposure of the next frame). Please, see the camera user manual for further details. Vertical Pixel Shift  Shift Speed Please, see the camera user manual for further details Vertical Clock Voltage Amplitude Please, see the camera user manual for further detailsInternal Shutter This option sets behavior of the camera internal shutter.  Open Internal shutter is opened upon NIS-Elements and stays opened through the whole session. Only with one exception: if the Readout Mode is set to Normal 80kHz at 16bit, the shutter stays closed and opens only for exposures. Closed Internal shutter is closed upon NIS-Elements startup and gets opened only for exposures. Isolated Crop Mode This option turns on the Isolated Crop Mode described within the Andor documentation. In this special mode, the size of chip is reduced and very high frame-rates can be achieved. Speed up Triggered Acquisition + Different Exposures  Connect the Arm and the Ext. Trig connectors of the camera and enable this option. When you run triggered acquisition with the Use different exposures option enabled, it will speed up the performance (the camera will not have to wait for software triggers but will be controlled by the Arm triggering signal). Region of Interest Unlike most other cameras, the camera region of interest cannot be defined on the live image but can be selected from this pull-down. Several predefined resolutions are available, all of them placed in the center of the sCMOS chip.Exposure Time  Automatically calculates the exposure time in order to achieve optimal brightness of the scene. Image quality is the priority, therefore longer exposure times are preferred. Apart from common selection of time values, there is an extra option called 1 frame . When selected (by the  button), the exposure time is calculated automatically in order for achieve maximum frame rate transferable by the camera link to the computer. 1 frame for Fast Timelapse The camera head is equipped with 4 GB of memory available for fast capturing. Use this button to run acquisition with maximum available frame rate. However, the size of image sequence is limited to 4 GB. The actual frame rate depends on other settings (readout mode, sensor mode) and is limited by the read-out speed of the camera sCMOS chip. Maximum frame rate can be achieved with the combination of Rolling shutter and Overlap sensor mode.  When using the Fast Timelapse acquisition, maximum number of frames which fit to PC memory can be determined by the Max button. However, due to specifics of Andor NEO this number is overestimated. The real number of frames is a sum of frames which fit to the 4 GB memory plus frames which are sent to the PC during the acquisition. It is impossible to predict this number correctly.Readout Mode  Within this option you can select a combination of these parameters - readout speed and bit depth. The settings influences frame rate and image quality. Higher frequencies increase frame rate, lower frequencies offer better image quality.Rolling shutter at 11-bit Fast, for common usage.Rolling shutter at 16-bit Fast, for high-dynamic images.Global Shutter at 11-bit All pixels are read at once. Readout Rate Select the readout speed 100 or 280 MHz. If speed is not crucial, leave 100 MHz. Conversion Gain This is a hardware pre-amplifier gain.

Overlap This mode enables the camera to achieve higher frame rates by reducing the exposure+readout time (the readout is performed simultaneously with the exposure of the next frame). Please, see the camera user manual for further details. Set Exact FPS Insert maximum frame rate (frames per second) you would like to use, this will prolong the total duration of the time-sequence in exchange for the reduced frame rate. This option may be useful especially when using the 1 frame for Fast Timelapse button with a small region of interest. Then the frame rate could get unreasonably high. The Limit MAX FPS is possible only when camera is in Normal mode (not overlapped), the maximum fps in normal mode is shown next to the edit box. Spurious Noise Filter This option reduces spurious noise. Try whether it has desirable influence on image quality.  Trigger Mode  Sets the exposure method. Internal The exposure time and the beginning of each frame acquisition is controlled by the settings the software. Strobe In this mode, the beginning of each frame exposure is being controlled by external signal.Bulb The exposure time and frames timing are controlled by external signal connected to the camera. Desired Temperature Sets the target temperature of the CCD chip. If you use the Apply button within the    window and the “Not enough memory” message appears, this message is not related to the on-head memory but to PC memory. NIS-Elements does not anticipate the number of frames which will be captured to the on-head memory, therefore the memory can not be allocated beforehand and therefore the message can occur.During Fast Time-lapse a progress bar is displayed. Indexes in the progress bar corresponds to the frames already transferred on the PC, not to the frames transferred to the on-camera memory.  Format Sets resolution of the image. The binning mode provides considerably enhanced camera chip sensitivity by integrating more elements (pixels) together. E.g.: binning 4x4 integrates the signal from the area of 4x4 chip elements to one pixel of the resulting image. Smaller resolutions and faster frame rates are achieved using the binning modes.Auto Exposure  Automatically calculates the exposure time in order to achieve optimal brightness of the scene.

If speed is not crucial, leave 100 MHz. Dynamic Range Dynamic range of a camera sensor is defined by the largest possible signal that it can generate divided by the smallest possible signal. Higher bit dynamic ranges bring wider ranges of grayscale levels from each camera pixel. Set Exact FPS Insert maximum frame rate (frames per second) you would like to use, this will prolong the total duration of the time-sequence in exchange for the reduced frame rate. This option may be useful especially when using the 1 frame for Fast Timelapse button with a small region of interest. Then the frame rate could get unreasonably high.

Use the    command to display the camera settings window.Fast, Quality  The software provides two resolution presets. The first is used for live image and focusing and the second used for capturing. The formats then differ in image size and in frame rate (number of frames per second - fps). The higher the resolution is, the lower frame rate can be achieved. Available resolutions depend on the camera type. When switching between the formats while observing the live image, the size of the image on the screen is maintained - the zoom setting is changed instead. Only in some special cases, the behavior changes and the image size is changed instead of the zoom setting which is maintained.Auto White Balance  This button performs an automatic white balancing. It calculates the right values and then adjusts the red, green, and blue image components in order to get a neutral white color. The Auto White gives the best results on color neutral (gray) scenes.Auto Exposure  Automatically calculates the exposure time in order to achieve optimal brightness of the scene. Image quality is the priority, therefore longer exposure times are preferred.Gain  Controls the camera sensitivity. Increasing the gain increases brightness of the image, but decreases quality (the more random noise, the more streaky noise and color unevenness), and increases the frame rate indirectly by enabling shorter exposure times.Offset  Sets the brightness of the image. It is a constant additive (positive or negative) changing all pixel values of the image. With negative offset value the dark image areas become pure black. Considering fluorescence microscopy, an appropriate offset setting can create continuous black background and thus help to enhance (together with gain or illumination enhancement) the contrast.Gamma  The gamma correction maps the intensity of live signal exponentially to the gamma parameter. For gamma &lt; 1, dark portions of the image are enhanced whereas for gamma &gt; 1, image parts of higher intensities are enhanced. Commands &gt; Auto Exposure SetupOverillumination Tolerance  Sets how many pixels should be white after the Auto exposure is performed. Use lower values (0.01%) for very bright (shining) objects (fluorescence). For common bright field, even 1% may be a good value.Autoexposure Mode When automatic exposure is run, the system calculates the exposure time and gain values. With this option you can modify strategy of the calculation:Normal mode Exposure and gain are balanced.Picture quality mode Bright image is achieved by increasing exposure time. This strategy produces minimum noise.High framerate mode Bright image is achieved by increasing gain. This strategy produces image noise, but allows maximum frame rate.Advanced Options&nbsp;Advanced users may modify the camera behavior by modifying the following registry key. Assuming your user account is named “Joe.Roberts”, find the following key in the registry editor:[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Laboratory Imaging\\Platform\\Joe.Roberts\\Platform.INI\\Misc\\grabber_imaging_source] There you can set the following DWORD values:SupportedCamerasMode Having one of the models supported by NIS-Elements, set this value to 0 to turn the FilterFormats and CameraTypeMono values ON. If set to 1 these values are ignored.FilterFormats Set this value to 0 to display all available camera resolutions in the camera settings dialog. By default (SupportedCamerasMode = 1), a reduced set of resolutions is displayed (the smallest/fastest resolution and the maximum quality resolution).CameraTypeMono Set this value to 1 if an unsupported monochromatic camera is mis-detected and offers you to select a color version. This selection and the resolutions suitable only for the color camera version will be hidden. Format For Live, Format For Capture  The software provides two resolution presets.

The probe  enables you to determine a small image area that serves as the data source area for LUTs, histogram etc. It also affects the AWB (auto white balance) and the AE (Auto Exposure) functions of cameras which support it. When the probe functionality is not supported, the AWB and AE algorithms are computed from the whole image. Table&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Camera support of computation from probeCameraAuto ExposureAuto White Balance   Andor - all models  The CCD chip is divided into two areas - the sensor area which captures the image and the storage area, where the image is stored prior to read out. The transfer between these two areas is much faster than the readout speed. The following phenomena may occur under certain camera settings.Blooming Blooming occurs when the charge in a pixel exceeds the saturation level and the charge starts to fill adjacent pixels. You should keep in mind, that saturated pixels often do not appear as overexposed in the image due to the CCD structure. Increasing the exposure time does not further brighten the image then. Figure&nbsp;58.&nbsp;BloomingTo reduce blooming, you should try the following procedure:Reduce the Multiplier value to minimum.Set the exposure time as long as possible with respect to the experiment demands.Increase the Multiplier value as much as possible without the occurrence of blooming.If this is not enough to see a well exposed image, use the Conversion Gain or LUTs to further brighten the image.You can also increase the Vertical Clock Voltage Amplitude. The higher voltage will increase the CIC (Clock Induced Charge) but since we speak about a bright field situation the CIC will be insignificant. Figure&nbsp;59.&nbsp;Blooming correctedVertical Blooming Suppose you have a short exposure, say 10ms, and the recorded signal level is quite strong but none of the pixels gets saturated. While the image is being read out from the storage area, light continues to fall on the sensor area and accumulates. If the read out speed is for example 3MHz it will take ~300ms to read out the full image. The sensor area have been exposed to 30 times more light than during the exposure before the readout is finished, the pixels saturate and the blooming effect causes the charge to overflow from the sensor area to the readout area. Figure&nbsp;60.&nbsp;Vertical bloomingTo cure the vertical blooming, you can:Increase the Readout Speed.Decrease the intensity of the illumination.Smearing If the exposure time is very short - similar to the speed of the transfer between the two halves of the CCD, and the intensity of the illumination source is high, a trail can appear in the image due to the smearing effect. Figure&nbsp;61.&nbsp;Horizontal SmearingTo cure smearing, you can:Increase the Exposure Time.Decrease the intensity of the illumination.  Obviously, the changes to camera settings suggested above will lead to some intensity/contrast changes in the image. These changes shall by compensated by other means such as Multiplier, Conversion Gain, Binning, Vertical Clock Voltage Amplitude or LUTs. ",

     xmlid: "id|binary.layersx",
     content: "         Commands for creating and editing binary layers are placed in the Binary menu. Basic methods of binary layer creation are:Thresholding This is the most common way of creating a binary layer for image analysis purposes. Use the    command to specify threshold limits, a binary layer will be created automatically. See  .Drawing Manually in Binary Editor A binary layer can be edited or even created manually using the built-in binary layer editor. To enter it, click   . See  .Spot Detection Spot detection is a dedicated segmentation method designed to detect circular objects. There are two commands for spot detection:    and   . See  . There are the following buttons at the bottom of the right image toolbar.   View Binary This button displays the binary layer only of the image.   View Overlay Binary layers can be displayed together with the color layer using an overlay mode.   View Color This button switches to view the color image (only).To manage display of multiple binary layers, use the    control panel. See  .     Run the    command to display the following panel. Figure&nbsp;363.&nbsp;Each time you create a new binary layer, it is automatically placed into the Working Layers area of the Layer List. Working Layers may be overwritten by the application each time a new binary process is performed. Therefore once you are satisfied with the layer content it is highly recommended to move it into the Stored Layers section using the   Store Current Working Layers. Make Selection Binary layers can be selected by mouse (pick more layers holding Ctrl or select a range holding Shift) or you can select all layers by clicking   Select All Layers.Duplicate To duplicate one or more binary layers, select them by mouse and drag-drop them to the empty area below the layer list, or click the  button. If you drag and drop a binary layer to some already existing reference layer, content of the dragged layer is copied to it.Remove Select the binary layers to be removed and click the  button.Combine Layers using Binary Operations If you drag-drop a binary layer name over another binary layer name, the Binary operations window appears. The same window can be displayed by the   Binary Operations Dialog button. If multiple layers are selected in the layer list and drag-dropped over another layer, the Binary Operation dialog calculates with multiple (more than two) layers. Available functions are dependent on the number of selected layers.See   .Create 3D Binary Objects To create 3D objects in the selected binary layer, click   Connect objects to 3D. If the binary layers are not defined for all frames of the ND document having more than one frame (e.g. only the current frame contains binary information), you can use   Fill missing binary frames to copy the binary from the current frame to all frames where the binary layer is missing.Change color Color of a binary layer can be changed using the color pull down menu. It offers a list of predefined colors. Besides the list of predefined colors it is possible to create a custom color (More...) or to colorize objects in a single layer using multiple colors (By Object/By 3D Object).Change order Use the arrow buttons ( ) to change the order of the layers in the list.Rename Double click a layer name to rename it. Only name of the Reference Layers can not be edited. If a binary layer is created by thresholding in the Per channel mode, such binary layer is automatically attached to the channel on which it has been created. Other binary layers can be attached to a channel manually:Right-click a binary layer in the Binary Layers panel.Select the Attach to Component sub-menu and select to which channel/component, the layer should be attached.Visibility of binary layers attached to channels can be synchronized with channels. Turn ON the   Synchronize binaries with channels button. Now if a single channel is selected for display, only binary layers attached to it are displayed and vice versa.To make an attached binary layer global again, right click the binary layer name or thumbnail and select Detach from Component.   The binary layer, as a result of thresholding, can be modified by hand using the binary layer editor. It is a built-in application providing various drawing tools and morphology commands. Go for the    command or press Tab. New buttons appear on the toolbars: Undo Reverses the changes made to the binary image.Clear Clears the binary image (fills the entire image with the “background” color).Load Loads the image previously saved by the Save button.Save Temporarily saves the current binary image.

Single binary objects can be erased in the following way:Run   .Select the Delete Object  tool from the toolbar.Click inside the objects to be erased. An arbitrary number of binary layers can be created within one image. Click this Create New Binary Layer  button in the image toolbar to add a new binary layer. The binary layer that you are currently editing can be selected in the nearby pull-down menu. Binary layers can be managed from the    control panel.     The binary image as a result of   often needs to be modified before a measurement is performed. Edges of the objects can be smoothed, holes in the objects filled, etc. by using the mathematical morphology commands. “Image Analysis and Mathematical Morphology” by J. Serra (Academic Press, London, 1982) was used as a reference publication for the following overview.The following tools perform basic morphology operations. You can find them in the    menu or in the    panel. Erode After performing erosion, the objects shrink. Marginal pixels of the objects are subtracted. If an object or a narrow shape is thinner than the border to be subtracted, they disappear from the image. Dilate After performing dilation, the objects enlarge. Pixels are added around the objects. If the distance between two objects is shorter than twice the thickness of the border to be added, these objects will be merged. If a hole is smaller than twice the thickness of the border, it disappears from the image. Open Open is erosion followed by dilation so the size of the objects is not significantly affected. Contours are smoothed, small objects are suppressed and gently connected, particles are disconnected. Close Closing is a dilation followed by erosion so the size of objects is not significantly affected. Contours are smoothed, small holes and small depressions are suppressed. Very close objects may be connected together. Clean This transformation is also called geodesic opening. The image is eroded first so small objects disappear. Then, the remaining eroded objects are reconstructed to their original size and shape. The advantage of this algorithm is that small objects disappear but the rest of the image is not affected. Fill Holes Fills the holes inside objects. This transformation is handy when objects have a rich inner structure with intensities typical for background. After applying the Fill Holes transformation, objects become homogeneous. Contour This transformation converts objects into their contours. Smooth Smooth affects rough edges of the objects makes them smooth. Morpho Separate Objects This transformation detects standalone objects that are connected together and isolates them. Homotopic transformations preserve topological relations between objects and holes inside them. Using a homotopic transformation, an object with 5 holes will be transformed to another object with 5 holes. Two objects without any holes, even if they are very near each other, will become again two objects without holes, but likely with a different shape and size. Opening, Closing, Erosion and Dilation are not homotopic transformations. Typical homotopic transformations in NIS-Elements are: Skeletonize, Homotopic Marking and Thickening. Applying the above mentioned transformations has some limitations due to digital images rasterization.When speaking about binary image processing, a binary image is a set of pixels where values 1 represent objects and values 0 represent background. In the square grid of the image, two possible connectivities can be used for processing - the 8-connectivity or the 4-connectivity. Look at the picture below. If the 8-connectivity is used, the two pixels represent one object. If the 4-connectivity is applied, there are two objects in the picture. NIS-Elements works with the 8-connectivity model, so all pixels neighboring by the corner belong to one object. Figure&nbsp;364.&nbsp;  When applying Erosion, Dilation, Opening or Closing, one of the parameters which determines the transformation result is the selection of kernel (structuring element, matrix) type. There are the following kernels used in NIS-Elements: Figure&nbsp;365.&nbsp;The bright pixel in the center or near the center of the kernel represents its “midpoint”. Example&nbsp;2.&nbsp;ErosionLet's assume 1 and 0 represent object(1) and background(0) pixels of the binary layer. You can imagine the erosion as the following algorithm:Move the midpoint of the kernel to every point of the image. Each time, look at the neighboring pixels of the kernel and make the following decision:If there are object(1) pixels in all the positions of the kernel, set the midpoint to object(1).If there is at least one background(0) pixel in the kernel, set the midpoint to background(0). Example&nbsp;3.&nbsp;DilationYou can imagine the dilation as the following algorithm:Move the midpoint of the kernel to every point of the image. Each time, look at the neighboring pixels of the kernel and make the following decision:If there is at least one object(1) pixel in any position of the kernel, set the midpoint to object(1).If there are background(0) pixels in all the positions of the kernel, set the midpoint to background(0). Example&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Open and CloseOpen is performed by eroding the image and then applying a dilation to the eroded image. On the contrary, Closing is performed as a dilation followed by erosion. If the midpoint is not in the center, applying erosions or dilations by odd number of iterations causes image to shift by 1 pixel. Normally, the total image shift would be determined by the number of Iterations (in pixels). NIS-Elements eliminates this shift: it changes the position of the midpoint 1 pixel down-rightwards within the kernel for even operations. For opening and closing it is possible to eliminate this shift totally. However, if you run the erode or dilate processes again and again using the kernel with even dimensions and odd number of iterations, then the shift becomes significant. Please see the following examples of some of the binary functions applied to an image. In the following sequence of images, the functions were applied subsequently: Figure&nbsp;366.&nbsp;Functions applied subsequentlyThe following images were created by calling each of the functions separately: Figure&nbsp;367.&nbsp;Single function applied to the original Figure&nbsp;368.&nbsp;Other functions applied subsequently ",

     content: "      Calibration of the image is of crucial importance to measurement. On calibrated images, realistic measurements can be performed and objects of different images could be compared to each other. A correct calibration has to be made before you begin to measure. There are two ways how to obtain a calibrated image:To capture images with a calibrated system (objective). Please see the   chapter which explains how to calibrate the NIS-Elements system.To calibrate an uncalibrated image manually: There are two ways to calibrate an imageManually After you run the    command, you can specify a distance in the image or set the current pixel size. Please see  Using Objective When you have an uncalibrated image, you can use an already calibrated objective to calibrate it. Right-click the Uncalibrated field on the image status bar and choose one of the objectives from the Calibrate using Objective sub-menu. Of course, the same objective which was used to capture the image shall be selected. It is possible to measure optical density (absorbance) and Brightness with NIS-Elements. A predefined calibration is used by default, but the user can make his own calibration curve to specify the relation between pixel intensity and density/brightness. For brightness, the default calibration curve is linear, for density, see   .Only the density calibration is described below, the brightness calibration is analogous except that it is started by the   macro command.The live image or a saved image can be used for the calibration.Run the   macro command, the following window appears: Figure&nbsp;373.&nbsp;Select one of the calibration methods2 Standards and Gamma If selected, you are supposed to use two density standards for the calibration and gamma parameter of a camera.

     content: " A digital camera mounted to a microscope port records images of the observed scene on a light-sensitive sensor, and transfers them to a computer. NIS-Elements supports various cameras differing from each other in resolution, frame-rate, sensor type, etc. Despite these differences, controlling different cameras is similar. The following features are included in the    window depending on a particular camera type. Camera-specific features are described in the   chapter.The complete list of cameras and devices supported by NIS-Elements is available in a separate document.Reference of Common Camera Settings ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,    1 frame for Fast Timelapse The camera head is equipped with 4 GB of memory available for fast capturing. Use this button to run acquisition with maximum available frame rate. However, the size of image sequence is limited to 4 GB. The actual frame rate depends on other settings (readout mode, sensor mode) and is limited by the read-out speed of the camera sCMOS chip. Maximum frame rate can be achieved with the combination of Rolling shutter and Overlap sensor mode.  When using the Fast Timelapse acquisition, maximum number of frames which fit to PC memory can be determined by the Max button. However, due to specifics of Andor NEO this number is overestimated. The real number of frames is a sum of frames which fit to the 4 GB memory plus frames which are sent to the PC during the acquisition. It is impossible to predict this number correctly.  AE Compensation  In automatic exposure modes, the compensation affects how optimum exposure settings (Exposure time and Gain) are calculated. The Compensation value is expressed in Exposure Values (EV). Setting the compensation to + 1.0 EV makes the image twice brighter (e.g. doubles the Exposure time or Gain).  AE Lock  This option makes the automatic exposure mode to lock the current exposure settings (Exposure time and Gain).  Analog Gain  Controls the Gain (Sensitivity) of the camera and strength of the camera analog signal before it is digitized. This setting affects image brightness.  Auto White Balance  This button performs an automatic white balancing. It calculates the right values and then adjusts the red, green, and blue image components in order to get a neutral white color. The Auto White gives the best results on color neutral (gray) scenes.  Averaging: .../%d  Averaging is a commonly used technique of decreasing noise in the image. In this method 2, 4, 8 or 16 consecutive frames are averaged together.  Binning  The binning mode provides considerably enhanced camera chip sensitivity by integrating more elements (pixels) together. E.g.: binning 4x4 integrates the signal from the area of 4x4 chip elements to one pixel of the resulting image. Smaller resolutions and faster frame rates are achieved using the binning modes.  Capture Bit Depth Channel Select per-channel bit depth used for capturing.   Clarify.ai Turns on the real time image clarifying function removing the out of focus blur. If any continuous scan is in progress (stage, well plate, or detection), a warning message will appear.    is not supported during continuous scanning.  Clear Cycles This option enables you to decide, how many times the CCD chip should be cleared (reset). The set Clear Mode determines how often it is performed.  Clear Mode  Sets how often the CCD chip will be reset. Please, see the camera user manual for further details. These options are available: AutomaticNeverPre-exposurePre-sequencePost-sequencePre and Post-sequencePre-Exposure and Post-Sequence  Contrast  Affects dynamics of how the luminosity is rendered. There are several modes for different illumination (contrast) scene situation.  Conversion Gain This is a hardware pre-amplifier gain.  Cooling The Qi1/Ri1 camera heads are equipped with a cooling system that enables the CCD chip to be cooled down by -5° or -10° of the current room temperature. When cooling by -10°, there might be a risk of water condensing inside the camera head (depending on humidity inside the room).  Denoise.ai Turns on the real time image denoising function. If any continuous scan is in progress (stage, well plate, or detection), a warning message will appear. Real-time denoising is not supported during continuous scanning.  Desired Temperature Sets the target temperature of the CCD chip.  Detector Mode Only in 12bit mode Timed A common mode for capturing images. Strobe If the camera controller is equipped with DS-RC switch, this mode needs to be selected to use the switch for capturing images.  Dynamic Range Dynamic range of a camera sensor is defined by the largest possible signal that it can generate divided by the smallest possible signal. Higher bit dynamic ranges bring wider ranges of grayscale levels from each camera pixel.  EM Gain Multiplier  EM gain allows weak signals to be multiplied before any readout noise is added by the output amplifier, hence rendering the read noise negligible. There is a complex relationship (approximated to an exponential) between the value set and the actual level of multiplication. Typically, optimal signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range is achieved between x1 to x300 EM Gain. When the setting exceeds the value of 300, the field gets highlighted red in order to notify you.  Exposure  Exposure mode determines how the Exposure time is calculated. Usually, the user can select between the automatic and the manual mode:  Auto Exposure  Automatically calculates the exposure time in order to achieve optimal brightness of the scene. Image quality is the priority, therefore longer exposure times are preferred. Depending on particular light conditions, the result of auto exposure may not be optimal for image acquisition. Under- over-saturation may occur when switching between  . Please see  . Available exposure time range depends on the selected Format and Readout Speed. Manual Exposure The user selects both Exposure time and Gain manually.  Continuous AE  When selected, the automatic exposure time is calculated continuously. If brightness of the scene changes, the exposure time is adjusted so that the live image is not over- or under- saturated.  1 frame  Apart from common selection of time values, there is an extra option called 1 frame . When selected (by the  button), the exposure time is calculated automatically in order for achieve maximum frame rate transferable by the camera link to the computer.  Exposure Time  Exposure time is the time of charge accumulation in a camera chip between two adjacent frames. Prolonging the exposure time increases brightness of the image as well as its quality (there will be less noise).  Fast (Focus),  Quality (Capture)  The software provides two resolution presets. The first is used for live image and focusing and the second used for capturing. The formats then differ in image size and in frame rate (number of frames per second - fps). The higher the resolution is, the lower frame rate can be achieved. Available resolutions depend on the camera type. When switching between the formats while observing the live image, the size of the image on the screen is maintained - the zoom setting is changed instead. Only in some special cases, the behavior changes and the image size is changed instead of the zoom setting which is maintained.  FOV Size FOV of a camera which has the sensor larger than the image from the microscope port (imaging circle) needs to be reduced. Otherwise, images captured with a too-large FOV Size would contain visible vignetting (will be darker at the periphery). Figure&nbsp;50.&nbsp;Correct setting of FOV Size 16 mm Suits most conventional microscopes. 22 mm Suits the Nikon Ti2-E microscope equipped with two filter-turrets. 25 mm Suits the Nikon Ti2-E microscope equipped with a single filter-turret.  Gain  Controls the camera sensitivity. Increasing the gain increases brightness of the image, but decreases quality (the more random noise, the more streaky noise and color unevenness), and increases the frame rate indirectly by enabling shorter exposure times.  Gamma  The gamma correction maps the intensity of live signal exponentially to the gamma parameter. For gamma &lt; 1, dark portions of the image are enhanced whereas for gamma &gt; 1, image parts of higher intensities are enhanced.  Hue  Hue shifts image colors across the rainbow.  Live Acceleration If the exposure time is too long, Live Acceleration helps you to make it shorter. The system automatically shortens the exposure time (so the frame rate rises), and the loss of intensity is compensated by increasing the gain (software multiplication). This procedure is not used upon Capture.  Internal Shutter This option sets behavior of the camera internal shutter.  Open Internal shutter is opened upon NIS-Elements and stays opened through the whole session. Only with one exception: if the Readout Mode is set to Normal 80kHz at 16bit, the shutter stays closed and opens only for exposures.  Closed Internal shutter is closed upon NIS-Elements startup and gets opened only for exposures.  Automatic Shutter is closed when the NIS-Elements is running. It opens only for acquisition.  Isolated Crop Mode This option turns on the Isolated Crop Mode described within the Andor documentation. In this special mode, the size of chip is reduced and very high frame-rates can be achieved.  Set Exact FPS Insert maximum frame rate (frames per second) you would like to use, this will prolong the total duration of the time-sequence in exchange for the reduced frame rate. This option may be useful especially when using the 1 frame for Fast Timelapse button with a small region of interest. Then the frame rate could get unreasonably high. The Limit MAX FPS is possible only when camera is in Normal mode (not overlapped), the maximum fps in normal mode is shown next to the edit box.  Keep Overlapped  If checked. The Clear Mode and Sensor Mode boxes are set to Automatic and become disabled. This mode produces maximal frame rate and decreases the list of exposure times (in the camera settings window). Only the times of 1 frame and longer become available.  Maintain Temperature on Camera Shutdown If this option is checked, the camera maintains its temperature until the computer workstation shut down. The temperature will be maintained for example during NIS-Elements restart or when another camera is selected.  Max gain Maximal camera gain.  Maximum Exposure  This is a safeguard of the time of the Auto Exposure. For quick exposure, it is convenient not to set this value too high.  Metering Mode  If this option is available, auto exposure can be calculated with an emphasis on overexposed peaks (Peak) or average pixel intensity (Average).  Mode Defines how the Auto Exposure is performed. Average is suitable for bright field and Peak is better used for dark field.  Multiplier Controls on-chip multiplication gain. There is complex relationship (approximated to an exponential) between the multiplier value and the level of multiplication - in other words, the value 2 does not mean the signal is multiplied two times.  Noise Reduction If activated, it reduces noise generated by higher gain. NR works on interframe basis so you may notice some shadows on moving objects.  Offset  Sets the brightness of the image. It is a constant additive (positive or negative) changing all pixel values of the image. With negative offset value the dark image areas become pure black. Considering fluorescence microscopy, an appropriate offset setting can create continuous black background and thus help to enhance (together with gain or illumination enhancement) the contrast.  Readout Speed The speed of digitization - influences frame rate and image quality. Higher frequencies increase frame rate, lower frequencies provide better image quality.  Readout Mode  Within this option you can select a combination of these parameters - readout speed and bit depth. The settings influences frame rate and image quality. Higher frequencies increase frame rate, lower frequencies offer better image quality.  Readout Rate Select the readout speed 100 or 280 MHz. If speed is not crucial, leave 100 MHz.  ROI   Select this option to activate the camera ROI defined via the Size drop-down menu. When active, the current ROI size is displayed in brackets. The user can define a custom ROI via Size &gt; Define ROI. The ROI can also be saved/loaded to/from a .camroi file (Size &gt; Save ROI/Load ROI). Nikon DS cameras have fixed-sized camera ROI, therefore width and height of the ROI cannot be changed. Only its position can be adjusted within this window. If a binning is applied, this size which is the size of the ROI on the camera chip does not match the size of the resulting image. Also, if you define the ROI with the binning turned on, the pixel size displayed in the definition dialog does not match the value then displayed in the brackets because it includes the binning factor.  Full Sensor,  Custom,  Optimal These buttons change camera ROI size. Full Sensor (requires:  )Sets the ROI to cover the maximum camera resolution. Custom Sets the ROI to a custom value. Use the Define ROI command in the pull-down menu to set the size manually. Optimal Sets the ROI to a computed size which ensures that no shading is visible on the image edges. The position of this automatic ROI can be adjusted in the    window. Depending on the actual system configuration, some of the buttons may be hidden.  High Quality Capture  When this option is checked, images are not processed by the camera control unit, but are sent to the computer in a RAW format. The computer then processes the images into the RGB format. This mode produces images with less noise and better color fidelity. Of course, transfer of the RAW data is slower than the normal mode which causes a lower maximal frame-rate.  Overillumination Tolerance  Sets how many pixels should be white after the Auto exposure is performed. Use lower values (0.01%) for very bright (shining) objects (fluorescence). For common bright field, even 1% may be a good value.  Saturation  The amount of saturation determines how colors are rendered. More saturation produces richer colors. Less saturation makes the colors gray.  Save Settings,  Remove Settings,  Load Settings Save the current camera settings by the   Commands &gt; Save Settings &gt; New Setting...  command and give it a name. Load the saved settings by selecting its name in the   Commands &gt; Load Settings  list. To remove a setting, click on it inside the   Commands &gt; Remove Settings  list.  Scene Mode  There are several camera settings presets optimized for a specific usage. Neutral Neutral preset. Industrial:  Industrial: Wafer/IC Wafer IC-Chip. Industrial: Metal Metal or ceramic.

Biological: ELA Illuminated enzyme labeled antibody method. Biological: BF (with white LED) LED illuminated bright field. Asbestos Asbestos. Linear Keeps linearity of the intensity when using a color camera.  Sensor Mode  This option sets the method of reading the CCD chip.  Automatic This option makes the system to choose the best mode.  Normal A standard mode where the exposure phase is followed by the readout phase. Please, see the camera user manual for further details.  Overlap This mode enables the camera to achieve higher frame rates by reducing the exposure+readout time (the readout is performed simultaneously with the exposure of the next frame). Please, see the camera user manual for further details.  Frame Transfer This mode enables the camera to achieve higher frame rates by reducing the exposure+readout time (the readout is performed simultaneously with the exposure of the next frame). Please, see the camera user manual for further details.  Sharpness  Some camera settings provide the sharpness control which affects how sharp edges in the image appear. Too much sharpness leads to over-saturated edges.  Speed up Triggered Acquisition + Different Exposures  Connect the Arm and the Ext. Trig connectors of the camera and enable this option. When you run triggered acquisition with the Use different exposures option enabled, it will speed up the performance (the camera will not have to wait for software triggers but will be controlled by the Arm triggering signal).  Spurious Noise Filter This option reduces spurious noise. Try whether it has desirable influence on image quality.  Target Maximum Intensity  Restricts the maximum of image intensity after the auto exposure was applied. The value represents a percentage of the whole camera dynamic range.  Trigger Mode Sets the exposure method. Internal The exposure time and the beginning of each frame acquisition is controlled by the software. Strobe In this mode, the beginning of each frame exposure is being controlled by external signal. Bulb The exposure time and frames timing are controlled by external signal connected to the camera. Triggered by master camera Having a dual camera system (or a special triggering device connected to the camera), you can use this mode. If the cameras Interval setting is set to No delay within the experiment or if the Live mode is run, the slave camera will be triggered only once so that both cameras will run simultaneously while single frames will not be synchronized. For all other settings, the trigger will be engaged once and all the subsequent frames will be controlled by the software as in the Internal mode.  Use Current ROI  The currently defined region of interest, set by the Define ROI command, can be switched on/off by checking this item.  Vertical Pixel Shift   Shift Speed Please, see the camera user manual for further details  Vertical Clock Voltage Amplitude Please, see the camera user manual for further details  White Balance  There are Red, Green and Blue Gain properties that control how colors are rendered.

The experiment is characterized solely by dyes, and the system automatically identifies the appropriate light path configuration for each dye. The light path settings can be adjusted manually by opening the   Edit window: Figure&nbsp;230.&nbsp;Here you can change the color of a channel, rename it, delete it (x), change its excitation wavelength (when switched to Expert Mode), change the Z offset, or add a Brightfield channel (Add Brightfield).The Single Channels experiment is created to efficiently examine an unknown sample by enabling the selection of any light source wavelength and viewing the results in a live window with a single channel. While the setup is similar to the corresponding channel in the \"All Channels\" experiment, operating it is simpler due to having a LUTs graph and a single channel tab in the live window. Checking the Single channels option means that even in a multi-channel experiment, only one channel is captured at a time. When you create a new setup (in the Device Manager) for the first time and have already created a reasonable All Channels experiment, the system automatically generates a corresponding Single Channels experiment.The behavior of the “Single Channels” experiment mirrors that of turning off all channels except the current one in the “All Channels” experiment, which can be done through the context menu over the channel buttons. To disable a channel use the  RMB over the channel button and select Off. If you check the option Channel Selection via Left Mouse Button (found in the General tab of the Configure dialog), a simple  LMB can be used to turn the channels on and off. Figure&nbsp;231.&nbsp;The Acquisition option on the right means that for a given experiment (given dye) a number of possible configurations (each one shown as a square) have been found and can be used for acquisition. Move between the configurations using the arrows. Figure&nbsp;232.&nbsp;The spectrum preview below shows the software pass for the channel selected in the drop-down menu.

     xmlid: "id|image.formatsx",
     content: "   NIS-Elements supports a number of file formats for opening. In addition, NIS-Elements uses its own image file format (ND2) to fulfil specific application requirements. The following list contains file formats which can be displayed in the software, however, if you do some changes to the files which you want to save, we recommend to use the native NIS-Elements format ND2 for that purpose - use the    command.AVI, MP4 NIS-Elements imports this movie format as a time-lapse sequence of images. Sound is not supported.JP2 - JPEG2000 Format An advanced format with optional compression rates. Image calibration, text descriptions, and other meta-data can be saved together with the image in this format.ND2 - N-Dimensional Image This is the special format for storing sequences of images acquired during ND experiments. It contains various information about the hardware settings and the experiment conditions and settings. It also maintains all image layers of course.NEF, NRW These RAW images produced by Nikon photo cameras can be displayed in NIS-Elements keeping the original bit depth (10 or 12 bits per channel).JPG, JFF, JTF - Joint Photo Expert Group Format Standard JPEG files (JPEG File Interchange Format, Progressive JPEG, JPEG Tagged Interchange Format) used in many image processing applications.TIFF, TIF - Tagged Image File Format This format can save the same amount of meta-data as JPEG2000. TIFF files are larger than JPEG2000 files but are loaded faster. TIFF files have several ways to store image data, therefore there are many versions of TIFF. NIS-Elements supports the most common TIFF modalities. TIFF image format in NIS-Elements supports also  .OME.TIF, OME.TIFF OME-TIFF is a file format that combines the TIFF image file format with the OME data model. OME metadata (OME-XML) are included for increased compatibility between applications.GIF - CompuServe Graphic Interchange Format This is a file format commonly used on the Internet. It uses a lossless compression and stores images in 8-bit color scheme. GIF supports single-color transparency and animation. GIF does not support layers or alpha channels.PNG - Portable Network Graphics Format This is a replacement for the GIF format. It is a full-featured (non-LZW) compressed format intended for a widespread use without any legal restraints. NIS-Elements does not support the interlaced version of this format.PSD - Adobe Photoshop NIS-Elements can display Photoshop images. Specialized features of the format such as vector or textual layers will be rasterized.BMP - Windows Bitmap This is the standard Windows file format. This format does not include additional image description information such as author, sample, subject or calibration.LIM - LIM Format Developed for the needs of laboratory image analysis software. Nowadays, all its features (and more) are provided by the JPEG 2000 format.LSM - Zeiss LSM Image NIS-Elements can display LSM images. Specialized features of the format may be omitted.ICS/IDS image sequence ICS/IDS image sequences are generated by some microscopes and consist of two files: the ICS file with information about the sequence; the IDS file containing the image data. The ICS file must be stored in the same directory together with the IDS file. ND Images containing multi-point XY dimension cannot be saved to a file in the ICS/IDS format. See also  .JSON - JavaScript Object Notation NIS-Elements can open the JSON format. It is an open data interchange file format.NDP, NDPI, VMS, VMU - NanoZoomer files We can open these files produced by Hamamatsu devices and save the image information to an ND2 file.OBF - Imspector files This file format is used by the Imspector software system for experimental control and quantitative data analysis.ShuttlePix files Nikon ShuttlePix Digital Microscopes produce standard TIFF and JPEG files and save the calibration info to a separate file. NIS-Elements recognizes the calibration file and loads it along with the image data. In NIS-Elements, a “floating point image” (FPI) is any image which has its pixel intensities represented by “floating point numbers” instead of integers. The format used is called “single-precision floating-point format” and it extends the available intensity range to 32 bits per channel (intensity can range from -3.402823 x 1038 to 3.402823 x 1038). In short, floating point images allow to store high-precision quantitative information and can be saved in TIFF or ND2 file formats.Here are some examples of functions which generate FPI:             At  , we recognize the importance of ensuring that all data and information produced by NIS-Elements software are open and freely accessible. To uphold this commitment, we actively promote the use of open and free formats, and we are steadily opening our proprietary formats, such as the nd2 file format, to users of all platforms.  is used for storing digital data, defined by an openly published specification usually maintained by a standards organization, and which can be used and implemented by anyone. An open file format is licensed with an open license. For example, an open format can be implemented by both proprietary and free and open-source software, using the typical software licenses used by each. In contrast to open file formats, closed file formats are considered trade secrets.Within the framework of Open Government Initiative, the federal government of the United States adopted the  , according to which: “An open format is one that is platform independent, machine readable, and made available to the public without restrictions that would impede the re-use of that information”.ND2 All information stored in the ND2 file (image data and metadata) can be read by the nd2 python module (pip install nd2) available  . The nd2 module source code, maintained and actively developed by Talley Lambert, is available at  . It is an open source implementation of the nd2 file format, completely written in Python and available to the public under very permissive license ( ). We, at Laboratory Imaging, are in contact with the author to make the implementation up-to-date and efficient. This is part of our ongoing effort to make the nd2 file format completely  .Web site for downloading the ND2 SDK (Software Development Kit) can be found  .Multi-resolution format can be used for scanning and we will support multi-resolution significantly better in the future. JOBs ( ) have an option to make multi-res nd2 files ( ) after acquisition (Generate Multi-Resolution option in the Job Properties dialog window) or from the    (Generate Multi-Resolution in the context menu over an image thumbnail).We support cloud storage and access to the nd2 files through the Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) web interface service using our S3* macro functions. This is currently an alpha version for testing (file compatibility on the S3 is not guaranteed for future versions). We want to allow to store and load nd2 files directly on the cloud. The nd2 file is stored on the cloud in nd2 chunks. The idea is to store this nd2 structure in the ZARR format (file storage format for chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays based on an open-source specification) so that third party software (primarily python nd2) can easily access the data on the S3 service.OME.TIFF OME-TIFF, developed by the Open Microscopy Environment consortiuman, is an open file format, making it supported by various image processing software, such as   or   using the  . NIS-Elements reads and writes OME-TIFF files in accordance with the newest  . The OME-XML metadata block is included in the header for increased compatibility between applications.By default, OME-TIFF supports only the 5D structure (XY + Z-Stack, Time, channel loops). NIS-Elements expands on this and supports writing the 6D, 7D, or 8D data using  . This may not be supported in other image readers that read all image data and metadata but may join some loops together.OME-TIFF is supported in JOBs  ( )  as an export format, but it may be slower than ND2. NIS-Elements also support exporting plate metadata readable by  .NIS-Elements uses generated pyramidal data for faster image view. Either pyramidal data is contained in the image, or NIS-Elements can generate pyramidal data for single-frame and single RGB images. In future versions, NIS-Elements will support generating pyramidal images for a wider range of OME-TIFF files. Pyramidal data provide no advantage for faster processing, which is done on the original data.TIFF tags 65325, 65326, 65327, 65328, 65329, 65330, 65331, 65332, 65333 are used to save additional information, such as binary layers, readable only by NIS-Elements. You will lose this data by re-saving the image in another software.JSON JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file format is used in NIS-Elements in cases when the users have a lot of files captured in a software other than NIS-Elements or they have less large files and they want to open, view or process them in NIS-Elements. Normally the data would have to be converted to ND2 which is quite time consuming. Instead, the user can describe the file (Describe) and save the JSON file with metadata containing just the information about how the individual frames are related. The JSON file can be created in    or by clicking on Describe when a file sequence is opened. Figure&nbsp;291.&nbsp;When the JSON is opened, denoising or deconvolution can be performed right away. The results are already stored in the ND2 file.h5 General Analysis 3 ( ) results are stored in an  , a well-established file format. To access the file, various modules are available, such as the h5py module in Python. The HDF Viewer can be downloaded  . For interpreting the data, utilize limtabledata.py located at NIS Elements/Python/Lib/site-packages. We aim to have all the NIS-Elements results in the h5 open file format. ",

This function only works with Nikon Ti2, NiE, Prior and ASI motorized stages. Reset Inactive Channels This button appears when using confocal A1, AX, and Dye Experiments when the camera capability “eccFrameSequential” is active. This means that the capture consists of several individual frames and is taken sequentially. Live then runs only on one or more components of the frame, not all of them. This button clears these inactive components during Live. Capture Inactive Components This button is used for re-scanning channel components when using Smart Live in Experiments ( ). Smart Live can automatically re-scan the inactive components when it detects that the user is not moving the hardware parts of the microscope system. However, it only re-scans if the hardware (e.g. filter changer) is not moving when switching to the inactive channel. This button then allows the user to re-scan the inactive components even if they are moving the hardware due to the channel change. The re-scan button will appear even if Smart Live is turned off, but it will trigger a user-enforced re-scan. Create Focused Image Creates an EDF focused image. See  .

Figure&nbsp;21.&nbsp;   Live Displays the live camera image according to the camera settings (the button changes to Freeze when the live image is shown).Smart Live The Smart Live function can be enabled in the  Configure... menu. It works only on Fluorescence experiments. It checks the hardware status, including stage movement and changes in the light power. Then it captures all channels if a hardware change affecting all channels has been made beforehand, such as a movement in XY or Z. However, if a change affecting only one channel has been made (e.g., a change in the power of the associated laser line), the other channels remain unchanged. Once the experiment channel(s) are captured, the light is deactivated. This ensures the convenient access to a multichannel live image without causing bleaching to the sample.   Capture Acquires a single image from the camera.  Auto Focus  Performs the fastest possible auto focus. There are two focus ranges available, short and long. By default, the short range is used. Hold the Shift key and click on the    button to use the long range ().The criterion for focus detection is dynamically changed based on the selected light path (modality).FLUO A criterion suitable for fluorescence samples.BRF Suitable for brightfield samples.

     content: "          Cameras and devices called “legacy” are no longer officially supported but should work with the current version of NIS-Elements. Drivers for these accessories are still available within the program setup, but are not tested any more. It is possible to change DS-U3/L3 controller settings. Appearance of the dialog changes according to the currently selected camera head:     Figure&nbsp;120.&nbsp;Camera settings - 8bit modeMode Select whether to use binning or not. The binning mode provides considerably enhanced camera chip sensitivity by integrating more elements (pixels) together. E.g.: binning 4x4 integrates the signal from the area of 4x4 chip elements to one pixel of the resulting image. Smaller resolutions and faster frame rates are achieved using the binning modes.Resolution  Fast (Focus), Quality (Capture)  The software provides two resolution presets. The first is used for live image and focusing and the second used for capturing. The formats then differ in image size and in frame rate (number of frames per second - fps). The higher the resolution is, the lower frame rate can be achieved. Available resolutions depend on the camera type. When switching between the formats while observing the live image, the size of the image on the screen is maintained - the zoom setting is changed instead. Only in some special cases, the behavior changes and the image size is changed instead of the zoom setting which is maintained.1280x1024 and 640x512 resolutions are available in 8bit mode.In 12bit mode, 320x240 and 640x480 resolutions are also available.Exposure  Auto Exposure  Automatically calculates the exposure time in order to achieve optimal brightness of the scene. Image quality is the priority, therefore longer exposure times are preferred. Depending on particular light conditions, the result of auto exposure may not be optimal for image acquisition. Under- over-saturation may occur when switching between  . Please see  . Available exposure time range depends on the selected Format and Readout Speed. Analog Gain  Controls the Gain (Sensitivity) of the camera and strength of the camera analog signal before it is digitized. This setting affects image brightness. AE Compensation  In automatic exposure modes, the compensation affects how optimum exposure settings (Exposure time and Gain) are calculated. The Compensation value is expressed in Exposure Values (EV). Setting the compensation to + 1.0 EV makes the image twice brighter (e.g. doubles the Exposure time or Gain).Commands &gt; Advanced Figure&nbsp;121.&nbsp;Advanced settings - 8bit mode Auto Exposure  Mode Defines how the Auto Exposure is performed. Average is suitable for bright field and Peak is better used for dark field.Image Settings  Noise Reduction If activated, it reduces noise generated by higher gain. NR works on interframe basis so you may notice some shadows on moving objects. Offset  Sets the brightness of the image. It is a constant additive (positive or negative) changing all pixel values of the image. With negative offset value the dark image areas become pure black. Considering fluorescence microscopy, an appropriate offset setting can create continuous black background and thus help to enhance (together with gain or illumination enhancement) the contrast. Cooling The Qi1/Ri1 camera heads are equipped with a cooling system that enables the CCD chip to be cooled down by -5° or -10° of the current room temperature. When cooling by -10°, there might be a risk of water condensing inside the camera head (depending on humidity inside the room). Detector Mode Only in 12bit modeTimed A common mode for capturing images.Strobe If the camera controller is equipped with DS-RC switch, this mode needs to be selected to use the switch for capturing images.  Figure&nbsp;122.&nbsp;Resolution Fast, Quality  The software provides two resolution presets. The first is used for live image and focusing and the second used for capturing. The formats then differ in image size and in frame rate (number of frames per second - fps). The higher the resolution is, the lower frame rate can be achieved. Available resolutions depend on the camera type. When switching between the formats while observing the live image, the size of the image on the screen is maintained - the zoom setting is changed instead. Only in some special cases, the behavior changes and the image size is changed instead of the zoom setting which is maintained. If the resolution of 4076x3116 is used for capture and the scale is burnt to the image, the scale position is different from the Live image. This is a consequence. To keep the scale at the same position as in the Live image, use other resolutions for capture.Normal, Binning Select whether to use binning or not in the Fast mode. The binning mode provides considerably enhanced camera chip sensitivity by integrating more elements (pixels) together. E.g.: binning 4x4 integrates the signal from the area of 4x4 chip elements to one pixel of the resulting image. Smaller resolutions and faster frame rates are achieved using the binning modes.High Quality Capture The High Quality Capture mode is also supported. If the Quality is 16bit or the resolution of pixel shift mode is selected, you cannot uncheck the High Quality Capture check box. When this option is checked, images are not processed by the camera control unit, but are sent to the computer in a RAW format. The computer then processes the images into the RGB format. This mode produces images with less noise and better color fidelity. Of course, transfer of the RAW data is slower than the normal mode which causes a lower maximal frame-rate.Exposure Auto Exposure  Automatically calculates the exposure time in order to achieve optimal brightness of the scene. Image quality is the priority, therefore longer exposure times are preferred. Analog Gain  Controls the Gain (Sensitivity) of the camera and strength of the camera analog signal before it is digitized. This setting affects image brightness. AE Compensation  In automatic exposure modes, the compensation affects how optimum exposure settings (Exposure time and Gain) are calculated. The Compensation value is expressed in Exposure Values (EV).

Average is suitable for bright field and Peak is better used for dark field. Noise Reduction If activated, it reduces noise generated by higher gain. NR works on interframe basis so you may notice some shadows on moving objects. Sharpness  Some camera settings provide the sharpness control which affects how sharp edges in the image appear. Too much sharpness leads to over-saturated edges. Offset  Sets the brightness of the image. It is a constant additive (positive or negative) changing all pixel values of the image. With negative offset value the dark image areas become pure black. Considering fluorescence microscopy, an appropriate offset setting can create continuous black background and thus help to enhance (together with gain or illumination enhancement) the contrast. Saturation  The amount of saturation determines how colors are rendered. More saturation produces richer colors. Less saturation makes the colors gray. Hue  Hue shifts image colors across the rainbow. White Balance  There are Red, Green and Blue Gain properties that control how colors are rendered. It is used to eliminate a color cast from white areas. Capture Bit Depth Channel Select per-channel bit depth used for capturing.

Average is suitable for bright field and Peak is better used for dark field. Noise Reduction If activated, it reduces noise generated by higher gain. NR works on interframe basis so you may notice some shadows on moving objects. Sharpness  Some camera settings provide the sharpness control which affects how sharp edges in the image appear. Too much sharpness leads to over-saturated edges. Offset  Sets the brightness of the image. It is a constant additive (positive or negative) changing all pixel values of the image. With negative offset value the dark image areas become pure black. Considering fluorescence microscopy, an appropriate offset setting can create continuous black background and thus help to enhance (together with gain or illumination enhancement) the contrast. Saturation  The amount of saturation determines how colors are rendered. More saturation produces richer colors. Less saturation makes the colors gray. Hue  Hue shifts image colors across the rainbow. White Balance  There are Red, Green and Blue Gain properties that control how colors are rendered. It is used to eliminate a color cast from white areas. Capture Bit Depth Channel Select per-channel bit depth used for capturing.      Figure&nbsp;126.&nbsp;Mode Select whether use binning or not. The binning mode provides considerably enhanced camera chip sensitivity by integrating more elements (pixels) together. E.g.: binning 4x4 integrates the signal from the area of 4x4 chip elements to one pixel of the resulting image. Smaller resolutions and faster frame rates are achieved using the binning modes.Resolution  Fast (Focus), Quality (Capture)  The software provides two resolution presets. The first is used for live image and focusing and the second used for capturing. The formats then differ in image size and in frame rate (number of frames per second - fps). The higher the resolution is, the lower frame rate can be achieved. Available resolutions depend on the camera type. When switching between the formats while observing the live image, the size of the image on the screen is maintained - the zoom setting is changed instead. Only in some special cases, the behavior changes and the image size is changed instead of the zoom setting which is maintained.Exposure Mode  Exposure mode determines how the Exposure time is calculated. Usually, the user can select between the automatic and the manual mode: AE Compensation  In automatic exposure modes, the compensation affects how optimum exposure settings (Exposure time and Gain) are calculated. The Compensation value is expressed in Exposure Values (EV). Setting the compensation to + 1.0 EV makes the image twice brighter (e.g. doubles the Exposure time or Gain).Exposure  Exposure time is the time of charge accumulation in a camera chip between two adjacent frames. Prolonging the exposure time increases brightness of the image as well as its quality (there will be less noise). AE Lock  This option makes the automatic exposure mode to lock the current exposure settings (Exposure time and Gain). Gain  Controls the camera sensitivity. Increasing the gain increases brightness of the image, but decreases quality (the more random noise, the more streaky noise and color unevenness), and increases the frame rate indirectly by enabling shorter exposure times.Color Auto White  This button performs an automatic white balancing. It calculates the right values and then adjusts the red, green, and blue image components in order to get a neutral white color. The Auto White gives the best results on color neutral (gray) scenes. Contrast  Affects dynamics of how the luminosity is rendered. There are several modes for different illumination (contrast) scene situation.Commands &gt; Advanced Settings Figure&nbsp;127.&nbsp;Auto Exposure  Mode Defines how the Auto Exposure is performed. Average is suitable for bright field and Peak is better used for dark field.Image Settings  Noise Reduction If activated, it reduces noise generated by higher gain.

The true (specified) exposure time is used only with the    and    commands.Qi1 Advanced Settings Figure&nbsp;129.&nbsp;Advanced settings - 12bit mode Cooling The Qi1/Ri1 camera heads are equipped with a cooling system that enables the CCD chip to be cooled down by -5° or -10° of the current room temperature. When cooling by -10°, there might be a risk of water condensing inside the camera head (depending on humidity inside the room). Detector Mode Only in 12bit modeTimed A common mode for capturing images.Strobe If the camera controller is equipped with DS-RC switch, this mode needs to be selected to use the switch for capturing images.  Figure&nbsp;130.&nbsp;Resolution  If the resolution of 4076x3116 is used for capture and the scale is burnt to the image, the scale position is different from the Live image. This is a consequence. To keep the scale at the same position as in the Live image, use other resolutions for capture. Analog Gain  Controls the Gain (Sensitivity) of the camera and strength of the camera analog signal before it is digitized. This setting affects image brightness.

The offset value can be typed right in the edit box. When you are about to turn the PFS ON, make sure the Focus indicator shines. It indicates that the PFS is ready to get to the defined offset position. The Memory and Recall buttons equal the buttons on the microscope body. Vast shift of the Z drive can cause that PFS will not be able to refocus. This is indicated by the Focus indicator which stops shining by then.Z Drive Movements of the integrated Z drive are performed by the up/down arrows. Accuracy can be set in the pull-down menu on the right. The Accuracy setting affects the Z drive speed slightly.Lamp Three types of illumination devices can be attached: Diascopic lamp, Intensilight fiber illuminator and TIRF illuminator. All these devices are controllable via the control pad.TIRF - A shutter can be assigned to close every time the TIRF position is being changed. To do so, right-click the TIRF logical device within the Device Manager window and select the shutter type from the context menu. You can set the TIRF control sensitivity (coarse, fine, or extra fine) in the Microscope Control Pad. TIRF can also be controlled by mouse wheel or joystick X axis (or both). Use the corresponding buttons to activate these functions. When using mouse wheel, press the button, the function is active only in the Control Pad window, not outside.Shutters Register the correct shutter types in the RCP. Then, the shutters can be controlled by NIS-Elements. When you connect the Intensilight by both RS232c and Shutter cable, two logical devices will appear in the Device manager for the Intensilight shutter and you will be able to operate it from two Shutter buttons (for ex. INTSL and EPI). In such case you should not set any of these shutters as the Active Shutter within the “Optical Configurations” window because NIS-Elements would get confused about its state (open/closed). So if you connect the Intensilight by both RS232c and Shutter cable, please disable one of the shutter logical devices within the device manager.Piezo Z An optional piezo stage is controlled equally to the Z Drive device.

Basically you select which wavelength(s) you want to use for illumination and set its light intensity. The selected wavelength modules are turned off until you activate the  shutter button usually placed in the bottom left corner of the control panel. A motorized stage being initialized could strike the objective. Before initializing the stage, make sure that the objective is away from the stage. If a motorized Z drive is available, use the    command to prevent collision.  Some microscopes enable you to reduce the range of movement of the motorized stage by setting limits within the configuration window.Display the configuration dialog window (within the    window).Move the stage to the position where the limit shall be set.Click the appropriate button.Set all the limits by repeating this procedure. This procedure can not be used if you already set some limits and would like to broaden them at the same time. NIS-Elements will not allow you to move the stage to any out-of-limits position. What you need to do is to reset the limits within the configuration window beforehand. Workstations can be equipped with two independent Z drive systems, one coarse (slow) and the other fine (fast).

     content: "         Extra-large images are usually obtained by stitching multiple FOVs together. If a single image (e.g. one ND2 frame) is too big to be loaded to RAM in one piece, you will be prompt to select a mode in which to open it:Downsampled (requires:  )A multi-resolution image will be generated out of the original. Such an image can be processed in the same way as a common image. See  .Progressive Only a thumbnail of the image will be loaded to the RAM. When zooming-in to view image details, the image data of the particular portion of the image will be loaded to RAM progressively (piece by piece). This mode is suitable only for viewing because many image processing functions get disabled in this mode.Split In case you need to process the image in full resolution, a smooth solution is to split it into tiles and create a multi-point ND2 file out of it. Please see  . On NIS-Elements start-up, the MaxMemoryImageSize parameter is set, based on the {% raw %}Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Laboratory Imaging\\Platform\\USERNAME\\Platform.INI\\Configuration\\DocuSet.MaxImageSizePercentOfRAM64{% endraw %} registry entry, where the default value is set to 25% of the RAM memory. Images fitting in this memory limit open in normal mode, whereas images exceeding this limit are opened in the progressive mode. This value can be altered in runtime using the {% raw %} {% endraw %} macro function (set as image size in bytes). (requires:  )A multi-resolution image is an ND2 file which contains not only the original full-resolution image, but also the same image saved in a reduced resolution. Once the multi-resolution image is created, then:Opening in the Downsampled mode is much faster.When opened in the Downsampled mode, processing functions can be applied to the reduced resolution. The image shall be then saved as a new file. If you overwrite the original file, you will loose the full-resolution data.Loads faster when displayed in the Volume View ( ) because the reduced resolution is used to render the volume data. It makes sense to create multi-resolution Z-stack images for images with one side longer than 1024px.

It can be re-opened in the Downsampled mode via a context menu.Right-click the image and select Reopen Downsampled for This Zoom. A reduced resolution is created and opened while the previous zoom and position is maintained. You can split an existing large image to tiles easily.Open the large image to be split.Run the    command. A dialog window appears.Set split options:Split to separate files - output format Select the output format (ND2 or TIFF). A separate file will be saved for each tile. Define Output folder and Prefix where the files will be saved.Create multipoint ND Document Only one multi-point ND2 file will be created and opened after the split.Set measurement frame after splitting The measurement frame will be turned ON after the split in order to exclude overlapping areas. This is to prevent distortion of data in case of measurement.Tile Size, Number of tiles Define width and height of a single tile in pixels or set the number of columns and rows to which to split.Overlap Set overlap value of neighboring tiles either in % or the current calibration units (presumably µm). Overlap up to 50% of the tile size is allowed, higher values are reduced to the maximum.Fill background Select a color to fill empty spaces which will appear the total area of tiles exceeds the image. Use Optimize to prevent the empty spaces.If you do not require the tiles to have exact size, click Optimize. The system will arrange/resize the tiles automatically so that the whole image is covered precisely.Click OK.At some point - after some processing is applied - you may want to re-create the large image. Use the    command to do so. If two images have matching XY coordinates you can locate the exact position in one image inside the other. This would be the case especially after using the    command. Right click the location within the first multi-point image and select    from the context menu. The point in the paired document will flash. Or, select Find and Mark this Point in Paired Document to keep the point visible after flashing.If you do this right after splitting the large image (the two images are “paired”), the system displays it and highlights the XY position by a flashing cross. If it is not clear to the system which images shall be paired (e.g. three or more images with matching coordinates are open), the user will be prompted to select the second image to the pair. Some NIS-Elements functions for creating large images by stitching multiple image frames enables the user to select a stitching method. Select the one you serves better your purpose:Blending Overlapping image parts will be blended. Figure&nbsp;328.&nbsp;Stitching via \"Blending\" (pixel intensity is changed in the overlapped region)Optimal Path A contour where two overlapping images are least different will be computed. The images will be stitched copying this contour. Figure&nbsp;329.&nbsp;Stitching via \"Optimal path\" (pixel intensity is preserved) A huge sequence of separate files on a disk can be processed as a single ND2 file without actually converting it to the ND2 format. This approach can save the user a lot of time. A textual (JSON) file is created next to the image data, the software then reads it as if it was an ND2 image. The basic procedure is this:Run the    command.Browse for the folder containing the sequence of images. Adjust the options and click the Convert button to save the JSON file.Use the    and browse for the JSON file. The image sequence will open. A command-line utility called “makelimjsonfile.exe” can be also used to create the JSON file. You will find it in the software installation folder. ",

     content: "          A histogram is a graphical representation of pixel intensity distribution in the image. It is a basic tool which is used during all phases of an experiment to assess the image information. It is especially useful to make sure there are not too many over- or under-saturated (overrun) pixels. Run the    command to display the histogram control panel: Figure&nbsp;350.&nbsp; Source data of the histogram can be viewed if you swap to the Data tab in the bottom-left corner of the window. The area from where the histogram is calculated can be restricted according to the selected histogram mode: The data are obtained from the whole image. The data are obtained from within the probe. The data are obtained from within the current ROI. The data are obtained from the image parts under the binary layer.  The source data or the histogram image can be exported to an external file. Display the Export pull-down menu and select a suitable destination. Click the button to perform the export. The Export ND histogram  button exports histogram data of all frames of the current ND2 file. The same destination which is selected in the Export pull-down menu is applied. Please, see the   chapter for further details. The histogram can be zoomed in and out using the zoom buttons on sides of the window. There are also other options to adjust the graph appearance:Left slider There is a slider along the Frequency axis. Drag it in order to stretch the view of either lower or upper values of the axis. Autoscale All Channels Zooms the graph of each channel separately to fit the available area. When this function is ON, the histogram is not proportional. Horizontal Auto Scale Zooms the graph so that the marginal zero frequencies, if there are some, are excluded from display. Graph Linear Displays the linear scale on the Y axis. Graph Logarithmic Displays logarithmic scale on the Y axis. Show Grid Turns on/off the grid in the background. If certain amount of pixels with maximum/minimum intensity values (black/white pixels) are spotted in the image, color dots appears above the graph. The color indicates which channel is affected. When you place the mouse cursor over the dots, a tool tip message appears with details about the percentage of under/overexposed pixels. The percentage limit setting is loaded from the LUTs settings (the color dots do not appear unless the set percentage of black/white pixels is exceeded). If the overrun concerns more than three channels (considering multi-channel images), only one white dot is displayed instead of many color dots. You can save the current graph to memory and display it later for comparison with another graph. Displays memorized graph. Memorizes the current graph. Only one graph can be memorized at a time. If any graph has already been memorized before, it will be overwritten by the current graph. Clears the memory. Drawing Style&nbsp;There are two ways the histogram can be drawn:Raw Data - tries to draw the source data precisely to the graphTrend Style - interpolates the data so that the histogram lines appear smoother.Histogram Options WindowThe graph appearance can be modified. Press the Options  button - a window appears where the following settings can be adjusted: Figure&nbsp;351.&nbsp;Histogram options windowColors Graph background and axes colors can be selected.Pen Width Set the width of the histogram(s) line to 1, 2, or 3 pixels.Fill Graph Area The area below the histogram line can be filled with the channel color.Graph Area Opacity Select the opacity of the Graph Area color in %.Vertical AutoScale, Horizontal AutoScale, Show Grid These options equals the corresponding buttons of the histogram toolbar.Interpolation method Select the way of drawing the graph line. The Linear (smooth) and Quick (precise) options are available.Show grid Shows the grid of the graph.AntiAlias Smooths the edges of the graph line.Horizontal axis always visible If checked, the axis does not leave the graph area while zooming in the graph.      If you work with RGB images, you can decide whether to perform the processing on single RGB channels of the image, or on the intensity component of the HSI color representation. The RGB/Intensity setting is global so it is applied to all the other processing commands automatically. When processing a multichannel image, this option is disabled - the operation is applied to channels automatically. In case the command does not open a window where it would be possible to make the choice, the setting from the last performed processing command (the global setting) is applied. Most of the image processing and binary image processing commands can be applied to one frame, all frames, or selected dimension of the ND2 file. When you use such command with an ND2 file, the following options are added to the command dialog window: Figure&nbsp;352.&nbsp;Current Frame The operation will be performed on the current frame of the ND2 file.All Frames The operation will be performed on all frames of the current ND2 file.Selection The operation will be performed on all frames of the selected dimension. If you selected some of the frames/loops of the ND2 file by mouse, the Selection option appears in the pull-down menu. Opt for it to process only these selected (green-highlighted) frames/loops. Options of some of the image processing commands may vary slightly depending upon the type of image being processed. See   for the more detailed explanation of the image types.RGB When the image processing function works with the image components, you can select whether the Red, Green, or Blue component is used.Mono You cannot select which component is used, because the image contains only one component, which is then selected automatically.Multichannel images When the image processing function works with the image components, you can select which component is used from the pull down menu or other selection tool. In image processing, a matrix, also known as a kernel or a filter, is a small rectangular or square grid which acts as a template that slides over the image, and at each position, it interacts with the neighboring pixels to produce a new value for the pixel in the output image. The size of the matrix, also referred to as the kernel size, determines the extent of the neighborhood considered for the computation.You can select different matrix shapes in some image processing functions which will affect the resulting image. E.g.:   . Figure&nbsp;353.&nbsp;Different matrix shapesSome functions support a “circular” matrix where different distances from the central pixel are compensated.

Click   Start. The system now finds the zero degree position and critical angle for the chosen directions and laser lines.Confirm the alignment by clicking OK and Close the Automatic TIRF Alignment dialog window. H-TIRF alignment is always associated to a specific objective. To save the current alignment state you can use   Save.... Manual alignment (for advanced users) Figure&nbsp;109.&nbsp;TIRF AlignmentClick   Alignment in the LAPP H-TIRF Pad. TIRF Alignment dialog window opens.In the 0° Angle section move the X and Y sliders to find the zero degree position when the laser beam is projected perpendicular to the ceiling.Click Store 0° to save the found value.In the Focus section move the slider to find the smallest spot size of the beam projected e.g. on the ceiling.Click Store Focus to store the found focus. Assist Focus can also be used to help with finding the focus value which is automatically stored when Assist Focus is finished.Run the   Live image mode and find your sample using the stage. It is important to precisely focus on the boundary between the slide and the sample in the Z direction. Also the camera settings play a big role when finding the TIRF angle. Low light microscopy principles should be utilized - long exposure, high gain, etc.).Adjust the Angle slider on the Ti-LAPP H-TIRF Pad for the selected Direction. Try to find the critical angle in a narrow strip where the intensity of the background decreases while the intensity of the slide-sample boundary increases.Once you find the critical angle, click   Set and confirm the new critical angle by clicking OK.Advanced functionsWavelength selector Switches from aligning All wavelengths to a wavelength-specific alignment. The wavelength can then be selected from the combo box. If you switch to a wavelength that is not currently used for illumination,   Sync Laser can be used to switch the appropriate laser line on. Sync Laser Turns on only the laser line which corresponds to the laser line selected in the Wavelength combo box. Advanced Options This button  opens the Advanced Options dialog where editing of the Critical Angle and Refractive Index values can be enabled. If checked, edit boxes appear in the Manual row of the Critical Angle section in the TIRF Alignment window. These critical angle values tell the software that the current motor position of the TIRF device corresponds exactly to the new values entered into the edit boxes (degree value with the specified refractive index). TIRF motors are not moved after this angle correction.Alignment Storage   Save... saves the current alignment state into the database from which it can be loaded using   Load... or deleted using –.  Clear Current clears the current alignment data (0° Angle, Focus and Critical Angle in the selected directions). There are few more ways how you can erase your alignment, e.g. by switching to an optical configuration having a different alignment, by switching to a wavelength-specific alignment back to All or by loading a new alignment from the database.Another way how to store alignments is to use optical configurations. Create an alignment and create a new optical configuration which saves all the alignment parameters in it (same as using   Save...). Switching between multiple optical configurations then automatically switches between their H-TIRF alignments.Angle control&nbsp;Angle is used to raise or drop the light beam. The graphic on the right shows the current angle value as a red arrow and the critical angle as a green arrow. If the current angle value is above the critical angle (green line on the slider) a rebound is shown. If the current angle value is below the critical angle, the beam goes directly through the sample. Depth represents depth of the evanescent wave. It can be seen as the marginal distance from the bottom of the sample up to a distance which we no longer want to visualize. Go to 0° moves the Angle slider to 0°.   Set sets the critical angle to the current position. Critical angle is visualized on the Angle slider as a green vertical line. It is automatically estimated in positions where the alignment is missing. To jump to the critical angle associated with the current direction click   Go to Critical Angle (enabled only if the Direction slider is on a position for which it was already aligned). If the current wavelength used for LAPP illumination is not aligned (No λ active! warning is shown in the control pad) then a different alignment for a different (closest) wavelength is selected. This wavelength is indicated in the bracket right from “Angle”.Direction control&nbsp;Direction (settings are revealed by the check box) represents the horizontal projection of the light beam on a 360° circle. Graphic on the right displays the current direction in red. Aligned areas are marked green. Green light next to the   Critical Angle button indicates that the current position lies on the aligned direction. Gray light indicates a non-aligned direction and its critical angle has to be estimated. Zero degree direction is shown as a short red line. Grab this line and move it freely around the circle to match the graphic with the real direction of the light beam coming out of the objective. Use the microscope eyepiece as a reference point. Hovering over the edge of the circle displays a hand cursor which can be clicked to Go to the selected direction.  The laser beam moves along the circle when its direction is changed by the user from the control pad. In other cases, horizontal and vertical movement is combined to quickly and more effectively switch between different positions.Focus control&nbsp;Focus (settings are revealed by the check box) is used to find the sharpest focusing value. It can be found automatically by clicking on Go to Focus or manually by adjusting the slider position in order to find the smallest spot size of the beam projected e.g. on the ceiling.H-TIRF Filters and Light Control&nbsp;Position of Lambda/4 and Gradation ND filters is indicated at the bottom part of the H-TIRF Pad.

Set an Angle and Direction in the Ti-LApp H-TIRF Pad based on your experiment needs and create a new Optical Configuration for each setup. Up to four H-TIRF positions (Optical Configurations) can be used in the Illumination Sequence. It is wise to name the Optical Configuration so that information about the wavelength by which the H-TIRF was set is saved together with the configuration (e.g. “HTIRF_488nm”).

If a binning is applied, this size which is the size of the ROI on the camera chip does not match the size of the resulting image. Also, if you define the ROI with the binning turned on, the pixel size displayed in the definition dialog does not match the value then displayed in the brackets because it includes the binning factor.

   { title: "Regions of Interest - ROIs",
     xmlid: "id|roisx",
     content: "          In laboratory imaging experiments, users are often interested in just a part of the image. To define such an interesting part of the image we use one or more Regions of Interest (ROIs). These regions are used later in analysis and measurements. Do not confuse image ROIs with Camera ROI which is used to reduce the active area to just a part of the camera sensor (CCD or CMOS). Such reduction usually results in higher frame rate. See  . ROIs can be created and edited using commands gathered in the ROI menu. ROIs can be also created from binary objects, graticules (for equally spaced shapes) and from binary layers created by tracking.  Figure&nbsp;369.&nbsp;Available ROI tools Global ROIBackground ROIMoving ROITurn Background ROI OnTurn ROI On Individual ROIs (ROI objects) are 2D objects. They can have different shape: rectangular, elliptical polygonal or Bezier. One shape can be created with one or more tools. For instance polygon ROI can be defined using both “Draw Polygonal ROI” and “Autodetect ROI”.In case of an ND file which has time axis (e.g. time-lapse) individual ROI objects can be defined as “Global ” or as “Changing over time”. Global objects do not change any of their characteristics over time. Objects that are defined as changing over time can change their position and shape in time (however objects cannot change their shape - e.g. from ellipse to polygon). This feature is useful for track moving or warping objects.To track moving objects use the “Edit ROIs in Time” editor or just change any global ROI into changing over time from the objects' context menu and move it or change its' shape (see interactive edit) on two or more frames. Such frames are called “key-frames” (2 shows trajectories with little boxes representing the key-frames). All frames in between key-frames are interpolated from these two key-frames. Frames before and after first and last frame respectively are taken from that first or last frame. Therefore it is not necessary to reposition or redraw the ROI on every frame.In case of Multi Point ND2 file there is one more option: ROI can be defined per Multi Point (which is the default). It means that ROIs from one point are completely independent of ROIs defined on the other point (even if they have the same number). This applies also to ROIs defined as “Changing over Time” (in case the image has time axis too). On the other hand if the ROI is changed to a “Global” it will be shared among all points of the Multi Point set.Depending on the application purposes ROI objects can have different usage. NIS-Elements can handle “Background ROIs”, “Reference ROIs”, “Stimulation ROIs” and “Standard ROIs”. ROIs can be manipulated anytime directly in the image window. Many of the following techniques work in ROI editors too. Objects cannot be moved or resized when they are Locked (some analysis tools or users may lock them to prevent accidental modification). They must be unlocked (from the ROIs' context menu) before any manipulation. Note that the mouse cursor changes over the ROI to indicate which action will be started after mouse button is pressed (it changes when modification keys like Alt and Ctrl are pressed).Selection ROI objects can be selected by clicking on an unselected object (other previously selected are unselected). Clicking on a ROI object with Ctrl key pressed results in altering the selection state. More than one object can be selected in this way. Double-clicking on any object results in only that object being selected. All objects can be selected by pressing Ctrl+A or by choosing “Select All ROIs” from the menu over any ROI. Alternatively, it is also possible to select a set of objects by dragging a rectangle around them with Ctrl key being pressed.Moving Objects are moved by simply dragging them (cursor indicates that). When more objects are selected, only the one below the cursor position is moved by default. This can be changed by pressing the Alt key and move all selected objects. When object is changing over time, any moving results in a new key-frame. Individual dots representing the key-frames can be moved too. It is possible to duplicate existing objects by Shift dragging. It works on selected objects. In case of a key-framed object, object is duplicated with all its' key-frames unless Alt is pressed.Resizing Resizing a ROI is done by dragging its' contour (the cursor changes accordingly). Note that the hot-zone (the area where mouse cursor changes into different tool) for resizing is outside of the object contour while the hot-zone for moving is inside. Resizing always affects only one object (selection is not taken into account). The behavior slightly varies depending on the object shape. By default resize does not hold aspect of the object - width and height can be changed independently. By holding Shift key aspect is maintained (useful for circles) and the center is not moved. Rectangle can be also rotated by using Alt key while dragging.Exact values can be entered in “ROI Properties” dialog which is accessible from the ROI context menu.  Figure&nbsp;370.&nbsp; When creating more than one ROI, the Simple ROI editor is the tool of choice. With this tool it is possible to make all possible shapes with different methods. All interaction techniques work here as well. Figure&nbsp;371.&nbsp;Simple ROI Editor toolbarNote that many actions have a hot-key (P for Pointing tool, R for Rectangle, E for ellipse, L for Polygon, B for Bezier, A for Auto detection, H for drawing holes and others) to speed up the process of interaction. Auto-detect tool is available from ROI menu, Simple ROI editor, Edit ROIs in time editor and some other places. It produces a Polygon ROI. Using the tool is two step process: The first click on an image structure results in preliminary object contour, that is drawn on the screen. After that, user can further tweak the object contour and then finish whole auto-detect by confirming with right mouse button. User can always cancel auto-detect by pressing the Esc key.The very first click is important, because these pixels under the cursor determine intensities from which the algorithm guesses the whole object. As a general rule it is better to choose brightest pixels in the bright objects (fluorescence) and dimmest in the dark object. It is also good to click near the center of the object.After the click the algorithm presents its guess of the object contour and goes into the interactive phase. In this phase it is possible to:Redefine the first point by clicking again in the imageCancel auto-detect by pressing Esc keyGrow or shrink the object area (changes the intensity range of pixels making the object) by scrolling mouse wheel or pressing PageUp/PageDown (for finer steps use Ctrl + mouse wheel)Erode or Dilate morphologically the object by 'E'/'D' or Down/Up keysOpen or Close morphologically the object by 'O'/'C' keysMorpho-separate portions of the object by 'S' or 'P' key (if it is not possible to separate the key does nothing) ROIs are used mainly in the following procedures:Time Measurement Changing image intensity inside the ROIs is measured.Automated Measurement Selected object features or numbers of objects inside each ROI are measured.Object Count ROIs are used to restrict areas of interest where the objects are counted,ROI Statistics ROIs are used to measure intensities interactively.In all these cases ROI selection is taken into account as well as intersection options in Measurement Options.Additionally the Time measurement interprets the ROI usage type. Background ROIs are used for offset subtraction and Reference ROIs can be used for bleaching correction.   (requires:  ) To define a moving ROI:Open or capture a time-lapse ND2 file.Display the first frame of the image and open the vector ROI editor by the    command.With one of the editor tools, draw the ROI around an object. Close the ROI editor.Right-click the ROI and select ROI Changes Over Time from the context menu.Play the image sequence and if the object of interest starts to move out of the ROI, pause the replay.Now it is possible to drag the ROI to the new position. If the ROI is created by the vector editor, its size and rotation can be also modified.Play the sequence further and drag the ROI to a new position each time the object in the image moves. ROI positions between two user-defined frames are interpolated. If the object of interest was moving at constant speed with a linear trajectory, then it would be sufficient to define the ROI positions only in the first and the last frame of the image sequence.Tips on Moving ROIAutomatic ROI Definition Automatic Tracking features may be utilized to define moving ROIs. Already tracked objects may be converted to moving ROIs by clicking the Binary to ROI  button.  See also  . Move all ROIs at Once Hold the Ctrl key to select/unselect more than one ROI by mouse. If you want to move all the selected ROIs at once, the Alt key while moving them by mouse, otherwise only the clicked ROI is moved. The Edit ROIs in time editor simplifies editing ROIs that are changing over time. Run    to display it. ROIs created and edited with this tool are converted into “changing over time”. All operations can be rolled back by Undo/Redo. Figure&nbsp;372.&nbsp;Edit ROIs in Time toolbarThe editor has two major tools: Draw and Detect. Both produce polygon shapes but in the first case it is drawn manually around a structure on the image whereas in the latter it is automatically detected after one click. When Draw or Detect is selected, it is possible to start drawing or detecting immediately as indicated by cursor symbol. In case of editing an existing object, it will be hidden after this first click is made, so the new one can be drawn unobstructed. Esc key is always available to cancel and revert to the previous state. Other tools are for Picking, Moving and Deleting objects.In this editor, there is always exactly one object selected. Its name and color is reported in the first combo box. In the image here reported, there is object 1 (red) currently selected. To toggle between creation of new objects and editing of existing ones there is the New button.There are some hot-keys that improve efficiency of the editing process:All tools have a hot-key (indicated with underscore and on the tooltip).Selected object can be changed with Up/Down arrows or number keys on the main keyboard (for objects with id from 1 to 9).Current frame can be moved with the Left/Right keys by one frame and with PageUp/PageDown by number of frames defined in the Skip combo. To move between key-frames it is possible to use '['/']' or ','/'.' for previous and next respectively. ROI Editor Options Move This tool moves the ROI to a different place in the image. As you place the cursor over the ROI, color of the selected ROI is indicated near the mouse cursor (this proves very useful when you have defined many ROIs, or they are overlapping). Simply drag and drop the ROI to another position. Pick Use this tool to select directly in the image which ROI you want to edit. Draw Use this tool to draw a freehand curve which defines new region of interest. Press the right mouse button to close the curve and finish the definition. Detect Enables the user to redetect ROI or to detect a new ROI (when the New button is pressed, or New item is selected from the pull down menu). New Press this button to create a new ROI. According to which detection tool is selected, you can either start drawing a new ROI, or click inside the image to let the application detect the ROI automatically.ROI picker Select which ROI you want to edit from the pull down menu.After Edit Specify which action is taken after a ROI has been edited.Do Nothing maintains the current frame and the selected object. The user must advance manually by hotkeys or ND navigation control as well as select objects by picking them or by means of hotkeys (1-9).Select Next Object If there are multiple moving ROIs, after editing the first ROI (Draw or Detect) confirmed by a right-click, the next object of this frame is selected. After all ROIs are edited it jumps forward to the next frame (according to the Skip option).Jump forward Jumps forward by N frames after an object is edited. It keeps the o object selected. “N” is defined by the Skip option. Use this option if you need to track one object from start to end of its trajectory.Skip Choose how many frames are skipped after editing of the current frame is finished. Skip 1 frame just moves to the nearest next frame. Delete Press this button to delete selected ROI. Undo /  Redo Moves back and forth through the history of changes. Help Displays help file.

     content: " (requires:  )(requires:  )Smart acquisition is an advanced capability of NIS-Elements designed to enhance efficiency and precision in biology research experiments. It allows the software to autonomously decide what images to capture based on pre-defined conditions set by the user. By continuously analyzing the ongoing experiment, the software identifies key events and triggers image acquisition only when specific criteria are met. This not only reduces the volume of unnecessary data but also ensures that critical moments are captured with optimal timing and accuracy. The acquisition conditions are fully customizable, allowing researchers to tailor the imaging process to their specific experimental needs. Whether focusing on particular cellular events, changes in fluorescence intensity, or other biological markers, users can set precise criteria to adjust the decision-making process.The “smartness” of any acquisition experiment is based on the cooperation of two powerful NIS-Elements modules:    Please visit the   where examples and use-cases from the field are published.

     content: "          Specifying correct threshold limits is a crucial procedure of the automated image analysis. The point is to determine which pixels will and which will not be included in the binary layer and thereby distinguish objects to be analyzed from background. Thresholding can be performed in the following modes:Open or capture the image to be thresholded.Run the    command to display the Thresholding panel: Figure&nbsp;355.&nbsp;Thresholding panelIn the top toolbar, select the color mode which will be used for thresholding. According to the type of image opened, the following modes could be available: RGB, HSI, Intensity and MCH. See  .Select one of the pixel-picking tools (e.g. ) and start clicking on objects in the image you want to detect. Color values of each of the clicked pixel(s) are used to adjust the low and the high threshold values so that the clicked pixel would stay inside the thresholded interval.Apart from this “clicking” method, the thresholds can be adjusted directly within the histogram by dragging the vertical lines which highlight the thresholded interval.All pixels having their numeric values inside the thresholded interval become a part of the resulting binary layer.Very often, also other binary objects appear in the image which you did not intend to detect, for example dust particles with intensity similar to the specimen, etc. To eliminate these mis-detected object, use one or more tools available at the bottom of the panel. You can either apply some morphology functions to the binary layer or apply size or circularity restrictions to detected objects. See  . RGB The RGB thresholding mode is available only if an RGB image is opened. There are two ways how to define the threshold limits, by choosing reference points within the image, or by defining the limit values for each color channel.HSI The HSI thresholding mode is available only if an RGB image is opened. The thresholding procedure works the same way as in the RGB mode except that the pixel values are displayed in the HSI (Hue, Saturation, Intensity) color space and that the Saturation and Intensity channels can be switched OFF. Therefore you can threshold over the H, HS, or HI channels only. Switch the channel off by deselecting the check box in the top-left corner of the channel histogram.Per channel In this mode, the channels are handled separately, a binary layer is created for each channel and also, the binary processing functions (Smooth, ...) can be adjusted differently for each channel. Switch between the channels by selecting their names in the bottom pull-down menu.This mode is dedicated to perform threshold on multichannel images, but can be applied to RGB images as well. It is not available when working with a monochromatic (single channel) image.Intensity The thresholding procedure works the same way as in the RGB mode except that it is performed on the intensity pixel values. Reset This button erases the threshold settings (no binary objects are created).Pick threshold from image - single pixel Select it and click inside the image to define the threshold. The threshold ranges will be adjusted so the selected pixel will fit inside.Pick threshold from image - 3 point circle Picks threshold from the radius of 3 pixels.Pick threshold from image - 6 point circle Picks threshold from the radius of 6 pixels.Undo Reverses the previous threshold operation.Redo Returns the threshold as it had been before the Undo button was used.Full Image/Use ROI If selected, threshold is defined only on the area of the Region Of Interest. Save/Load Threshold Settings This button invokes a pull-down menu which enables the user to load/save the current threshold settings from/to an external file (*.threshold). Zoom Zoom the histogram in/out.Auto Zoom Zooms the histogram to fit the preview window.Auto Range Zooms the histogram so that the “high” and “low” threshold lines are distinguishable. For example, if a small intensity range is defined on a 16bit image the low and high lines are displayed as one-pixel line. Pressing this button will stretch the histogram in order to display the lines separately. Threshold the image using the Intensity measurement option in the Thresholding control panel. Figure&nbsp;356.&nbsp;Clean the image to remove detected small non-nuclei areas.Select features to be measured in the Automated Measurement Results control panel. Press the Options button and choose the Select Object Features command. An Object Measurement Setup window appears. Add or remove features you want to measure.Press the  Update measurement button in the Automated Measurement Results control panel to measure image features. Overview the results. Press the Store Data button to save the data for future reference. Figure&nbsp;357.&nbsp;Right click the  Turn ROI On/Off button in the right document toolbar. Choose the    command. Each binary object turns into separate ROI. Figure&nbsp;358.&nbsp;Threshold the cell nucleoli in the nuclei the same way as was already described above using the Thresholding control panel.Measure the thresholded nucleoli using the  Update measurement button in the Automated measurement Results control panel. Press the Store Data button to save the data.Group results per ROI: drag the title of the column called RoiID into the grey area above the columns. You can drag and drop any combination of features as well. Results always group according to such selected features.Turn on the graph using the  Show Histogram button. Figure&nbsp;359.&nbsp;The histogram displays the selected feature of interest. If you want to display different feature - press the right mouse button over the data table on the left and open the Feature of Interest submenu. Select another feature. The histogram recalculates automatically.To get the information about area percentage, select the Field measurement option in the top toolbar of the Automated measurement Results control panel. Figure&nbsp;360.&nbsp;ExampleField 1 displays results of measurement when measured without ROI. That means % of nucleoli in the entire image.Field 2 displays results of measurement when measure with ROI on. That means % of nucleoli within the nuclei.You can export the result to various locations using the Export command. Threshold AdjustmentsThresholding parameters can be adjusted very precisely in the following way:Threshold limits of each channel can be adjusted by rewriting the values in the top-left/top-right corner of each channel histogram.Threshold range of each channel (the colored stripe) can be shifted by mouse. Place the cursor in the middle of the range (a circle appears) and drag it left or right.Threshold limits of each channel can be adjusted by mouse. Place the cursor on the edge of the thresholding range and drag it left or right.The two last behaviors can be further modified by pressing additional keys:Move the threshold using the right mouse button - the binary layer in the image is not updated continuously, but is updated only once after the mouse button is released. Such operation saves some computing and therefore is quicker.Hold Shift while moving the threshold limits - the threshold adjustment is performed on all channels together (RGB images only).Hold Ctrl while moving the threshold limits - both the low and the high threshold limits move in opposite directions.Binary OperationsFour basic operations can be performed on the binary layer before it is displayed on screen. To turn the operation on, click on the up arrow button in order to define the number of its iterations:Clean Removes small objects from binary image.Smooth Smooths the binary image contours.Fill Holes Fills holes within binary objects.Separate Separates objects.RestrictionsSize Define size range using min/max value in the edit boxes or using the slider.Circularity Define circularity range using min/max value in the edit boxes or using the slider.Thresholding Large Images&nbsp;If thresholding images larger than 5000 x 5000 pixels, a new check box called Preview on selected area only is displayed. This feature displays the threshold preview just on a limited area to speed up the thresholding adjustment.Changing Appearance of the Binary Layer&nbsp;To change the color or transparency of the layer, right-click the  Overlay button in the right image toolbar. A contextual menu appears, where you can select one of the predefined transparency levels, or run the Colorize Binary Objects command. This command displays the binary objects in several different colors. The algorithm ensures that two neighboring objects are never colored by similar colors.See  . This function opens the Spot Detection dialog window. It is used mainly for detecting circular objects with similar sizes. Bright spot and dark spot detection methods are split into individual dialog windows. Figure&nbsp;361.&nbsp;A typical, suitable sample for Spot Detection. How to detect Circular AreasOpen your image for the detection.Select the proper detection method. For bright spots on a dark background run Bright Spots. For dark spots on a bright background run Dark Spots.Make sure Preview is checked.Select the Channel on which the detection will be performed.Choose the Clustered or Different Sizes detection Method based on your image.Adjust the Typical Diameter of the objects you want to detect so that they fit tightly inside the circles.Remove unwanted objects by adjusting the Contrast value. When it is set to zero, all spots with the set diameter are detected. Once you raise the value, spots with the lowest contrast will start to disappear.Optionally adjust the Remove Dark Objects slider to remove undesirable dark spots.If you are satisfied with the object detection, choose where to apply the current settings (Current Frame, All Frames or a Selection) and click OK. Now you can save the new binary layer together with your file. Circular areas detected close to each other are automatically separated. Figure&nbsp;362.&nbsp;Circular Area output To see the binary layers as shown in the image above, right-click the  View Overlay icon on the Image window toolbar and select Transparency 100% or use Ctrl+up/down arrow keys. How to detect SpotsDo steps 1-8 from the   procedure.Switch the Output from Circular Area to Spot and adjust the pixel size of the spots.Choose where to apply the current settings (Current Frame, All Frames or a Selection) and click OK. How to detect GrowingDo steps 1-8 from the   procedure.Check the Growing check box.Adjust the slider position to augment/diminish the regions. Optionally use the  Pick intensity feature to grab the pixel intensity threshold directly from your image.Choose where to apply the current settings (Current Frame, All Frames or a Selection) and click OK.Spot Detection OptionsChannel Select a channel on which you want to detect objects. If multichannel file is opened, spectral group selection is available.Method For Bright Spots detection choose   Bright, Clustered detection method, if you want to detect clustered bright objects on a dark background, or   Bright, Different Sizes for detecting differently sized bright objects on a dark background.For Dark Spots detection choose   Dark, Clustered detection method if your clustered objects are dark and their background is light or   Dark, Different Sizes method if your objects have different sizes and your background is light.Output Binary output defines in which form the detected objects will be saved. Circular Area saves one circle for each detected spot whereas Spot saves a center point with a defined pixel size.Growing The Growing check box can be used to save grown regions with borders between adjacent spots. The function itself finds local threshold values for each of the spots detected. Therefore it matches the exact shape of the object. The numeric value represents image intensity degrees.  Pick intensity function can be used to get a reference pixel intensity from the picture by a single mouse click. Use the slider to adjust the Growing value.Typical Diameter Adjust the typical size of your objects using the slider or edit box.Contrast Adjust the contrast value of your spots using the slider or edit box.Object symmetry Can be used to add yet undetected/remove already detected spots based on their symmetry.Remove Dark Objects Check this option and adjust the position of the slider to exclude dark objects. The more left you move the slider, the more objects appear.Z-axis elongation Improves detection of 3D spots extended in the Z dimension. Select the Z-axis elongation ratio from the combo box.Separate touching spots Separates spots overlapping in the 3D space.

NIS-Elements handles hardware accessories using the concept of logical devices. There are features of different hardware devices which equal and therefore can be controlled equally. Such features are called “logical devices”. A typical logical device is Stage XY. Microscopes can be equipped with different XY motorized stages, although - regarding the user interface - they behave equally. One physical device (a piece of hardware) can contain one or more logical devices the list of which appear in the Device Manager after the connection is established. Analyzer The analyzer is a polarizing filter placed in the optical path between the specimen and the lamp. The logical device offers two states: ON (inserted) and OFF (extracted).Aperture This logical device is used for controlling apertures in the light path. It is used in complex microscopes rather than as a standalone device. Two parameters can be typically set for aperture devices, the state (on/off) and aperture size.Condenser A condenser is a two-lens combination located next to the illumination source in the optical path. Its purpose is to collect light and direct it to the specimen being examined. The corresponding logical device relates to a changer of different condensers.Filter This logical device controls filter changer movements. There can be several filter changers connected to NIS-Elements at a time. Each filter changer needs to be set up - filter types shall be assigned to positions of the changer:Display the filter changer control panel (   or   ).Click the settings button , a window appears.Select one of the available positions which the filter will be assigned to.Click the ... button, a list of available filters appears.Select the filter name from the list and confirm it by OK.The filters can be moved within the already defined positions using the Up and Down arrow buttons.  When browsing the list of filters, details about the currently selected filter are displayed on the right side of the window.Illuminator This logical device is used for controlling the specimen illumination remotely. There is no standard dialog box for the illuminator control. Each device handles this logical device via a user interface specially designed for it - typically containing one button for switching it on/off and a slider for regulating intensity.Light Path Some microscopes have more than one port where it is possible to attach a light source or a camera. This logical device can switch the illumination between these ports.Microscope This logical device is used to group standalone logical devices used in certain microscopes. To control the logical devices of a microscope from one control panel, select the    command.Nosepiece This logical device serves for controlling microscope objective changers.See  ,  .ND Filter A neutral-density filter is a light absorbing filter whose absorption spectrum is moderately flat. It is used to reduce the illumination intensity within the optical path. The logical device offers two states: ON (inserted) and OFF (extracted).PFS Perfect Focus System - this logical device corresponds to the PFS physical device available with Nikon TE2000/TI microscopes.Shutter This logical device can control shutters installed in your system. This device is handled via the    control panel or straight from the microscope control pad. You can select the type and rename the shutter by running a contextual menu command either within the Filters and Shutters control panel, Device Manager window, or in the main toolbar. There was a restricted number of shutters which could be connected to the system in previous releases of NIS-Elements and they were identified by Type (DIA, EPI, Aux1, etc...). The current version supports identification of shutters by custom Names, but the Type attribute can be still found in some windows (or used in some macro functions). This is to ensure backward compatibility.Zoom This logical device is used for controlling the zoom factor.Run the    command to adjust the zoom settings.Stage XY Stage XY enables the movement of specimen within X and Y axes. The system offers user to control stage movements.Z Drive The Z Drive device enables movement throughout the Z axis direction.TTL Input, TTL Output, Analog Input, Analog Output There are six more logical devices available when the NIDAQ controller set is installed:TTL InputTTL OutputAnalog InputAnalog OutputCalibrated Analog Input and Calibrated Analog Output.Each of these logical devices represents a connection to an external device which can receive (send) signals from (to) NIS-Elements. The number of available connections depends on the actual NIDAQ card.See    For the purposes of this manual, we distinguish the following device types. Each type provides a different level of control from the software.Manual It cannot be controlled via the software neither the software is aware of its current state. For the purposes of image acquisition, the current state of such a device shall be set in the software manually so that the meta-data of the acquired image would be correct. This typically concerns a manual nosepiece or a filter changer.Intelligent The current state of the device is displayed within the software GUI, but the device cannot be controlled.Motorized The device can be fully controlled via the Microscope Control Pad or other panels.
