Only electronic triggerable shutters support this feature - i.e. shutters which do not physically move any of their components but just control LEDs, AOTF, etc., and at the same time have the triggering ability (can be used in Triggered Acquisition or are triggerable virtual shutters of a multilaser).Flip, Rotate, Get Angle Define operations to be made to the camera image. See  . Camera Rotation and FlippingInvoke the    command and select the Auto option (see  ). The Flip and Angle parameters are calculated automatically. However, the Flip option needs to be checked only in rare cases, e.g. when a camera is attached to the bottom port of the Ti microscope.It is always recommended to Rotate the camera mechanically to get correct rotation of the image. When this is not possible, define how the image frames and XY axes are rotated.Use the Angle parameter when a motorized XY stage is mounted. E.g. for dragging the stage by mouse within the field of view, stitching, etc. This parameter is not used for manual microscopes - the default value can be left.You can also use the Get Angle button, which automatically finds the camera angle.     Acquire &gt; Capture Button Setup🔗  This command is displayed in the main menu only if either of the following hardware is connected to NIS-Elements:DS-Qi2/Ri2 cameraDS-L3/U3 camera unitNi-E / Ci-E / Ni-U microscopeThis command acquires an image by the hardware button on a device under predefined conditions, with optical configurations and cameras. All the settings can be defined within a dialog which appears: Output setting of the capture button is reset to “DSC” after turning off the power of the ECLIPSE Ci microscope main body. Please change it to USB again by the Ni Setup Tool or DS-L3 after restarting the Ci microscope if you want to use device capture via USB in the same way as the last time.

Acquire &gt; Camera Settings 🔗 This command adjusts parameters of the currently used camera. The Camera Settings dialog box appears.Please see  . After this command is run, the Live image will start automatically. If some processing has been made on the Frozen image, the processing results will be lost.     Acquire &gt; Live - Fast🔗 Displays the live image in the picture window. You can usually define its resolution by the    command. Some image operations automatically freeze the image in order to perform operations correctly, e.g. NIS-Elements swaps live and freeze image display mode when preprocessing, transformation and measurement commands are invoked.     Acquire &gt; Live - Quality🔗 Displays the capture-quality live image in the picture window. You can usually define its resolution by the    command. Some image operations automatically freeze the image in order to perform operations correctly, e.g. NIS-Elements swaps live and freeze image display mode when preprocessing, transformation and measurement commands are invoked.     Acquire &gt; Freeze🔗 Freezes and grabs live image into the picture window.     Acquire &gt; Capture🔗 This command captures the current scene and displays the image in a new window. See  .     Acquire &gt; Auto Capture 🔗 This command captures the current live image and saves it to the    according to the   . You can create sequences of images via this command. The Auto Capture button in the application top toolbar can perform the same function.     Acquire &gt; Average &gt; Average (N)🔗 Averaging is a good noise-reduction technique. Use this function to set the averaging parameter of the acquisition to the number indicated in brackets. For example, if you are capturing with Average 4x, the software will use 4 frames received from the camera to create one resulting image by averaging their pixel intensities. Averaging reduces the frame rate accordingly.     Acquire &gt; Average &gt; Average to Quality🔗 If turned on, averaging is performed until the Quality limit or the maximum specified frame count are reached. You can change the Quality limit by the    command. ExampleLet's set the averaging to 16x and turn the    option on.A Quality value is computed for two subsequent averaged images (e.g. AVG(4) and AVG(5)). The quality value is defined as the average difference per pixel in Decibels. It characterizes how much the two images differ. The greater the Quality is, the less the images differ.If Quality gets greater or equal to the Quality limt or the limit of 16 averaged camera frames is reached, the image is captured.It is recommended to experiment with the Quality limit value and optimize it for your samples and camera. The default value is 35.     Acquire &gt; Average &gt; Define Average to Quality🔗 This command opens a window which sets the quality value for averaging: Figure&nbsp;1519.&nbsp;The quality value is defined as average difference per pixel per component in Decibels. See    for explanation.     Acquire &gt; Integrate &gt; Integrate (N)🔗 Integration comes handy for low-signal (dark) scenes. Use this function to set the integrating parameter of the acquisition to the number indicated in brackets. For example, if 4x is indicated in the brackets, the software will use 4 frames received from the camera to create one resulting image by integrating their pixel intensities. Integration reduces the frame rate accordingly.

Acquire &gt; Manual Large Image🔗 Opens the Manual Large Image Grabbing window used for custom large image acquisition. It is useful especially if the user does not know the shape (area) of the sample being acquired, captures it without an overlap or wants to decide at any given moment which parts of the sample will be grabbed. Start Starts the image grabbing by capturing the first tile on the current XY position. Capture Captures a tile on the current XY position and adds it to the large image preview. Use the space bar as a keyboard shortcut for capturing. Finish Finishes the large image acquisition creating a large image document. Live Turns on the live image. Freeze Pauses the camera live view. Remove the last tile Deletes the tile captured last. Only one step back is possible. Remove all tiles and start again Deletes all tiles captured so far and starts the large image grabbing all over again. Auto Capture Automatically captures a tile if:tile overlapping area is ≤ 14 %, orthe image is static for a while.The border of the frame is green during moving, changes to purple when the overlap is ≤ 14 % and turns red when it is completely out (move closer to the previous tile in such a case). Auto Shading Correction Applies the automatic shading correction to the captured tiles. If this option is turned on and the large image grabbing is finished (  Finish), the selected shading (indicated in the brackets) is applied to the large image. Thus the user can preview the image before creating the large image and decide whether to use the shading correction or not. Click on the  arrow button to choose the type of correction which best represents the background of your sample image. Show live and preview windows side by side Shows the live window and the preview window next to each other. Fit to Screen Adjusts the zoom so that the tiles fit the preview window. Zoom In Zooms the preview window in. Zoom Out Zooms the preview window out.     Acquire &gt; Scan Large Image🔗 (requires:  )This command captures large images using the Macro overview. The scanning is performed the similar way to a manual large image grab, except the meander movements are realized via the stage control. The large image scan procedure scans the specimen in the way of the meander, covering the whole area of the rectangle specified by the user. The rectangle can be specified either by the current position and the number of fields or by specifying the rectangle margins (pressing the appropriate button, the user specifies that the current stage position corresponds to the appropriate rectangle margin). While setting the scanning area, the user can move the stage using joystick. While scanning, the system displays the particular result enabling the possibility to interrupt the process by pressing the Cancel button. Figure&nbsp;1528.&nbsp; Capturing Choose one of available optical configurations and objectives which can be assigned for scanning Macro Image and Large image Scanning from the pull down menus.

This concerns the    command.Wait after Stage Movement This delay between captures can be used for sample stabilization, e.g. after XY movement or autofocus. If 0 ms is entered, then Continue is displayed and the user can click this button in order to continue with the next capture.Overlap Choose whether the images will overlap. If you select the Overlap option, set also percentage of one frame overlapping its neighbour and a stitching method. Blending method blends the overlapping image parts and Optimal path method computes a contour in places where two overlapping images are least different and then they are stitched copying this contour (see:  ). Image Registration compares the image texture and automatically adjusts the position of images. If there are pixel-shifts between neighboring images, this function will help. If there is no overlap, the frames are stitched without using the registration algorithm.Shading correction This option turns on the shading correction. It is a crucial feature that allows to scan sufficiently homogeneous images. A “Per Optical Configuration” shading correction must be setup beforehand in order for this option to be enabled. Please see    for further details.Automatic Shading Correction&nbsp;To perform the shading correction on captured images automatically without capturing the shading image, check this option and select the type of correction which best represents the background of your sample image. If Automatically per channel is selected, the shading modality method is detected and applied per channel.Storage Create large image After scanning one large image is created. This option is checked by default.Store Single Images If you select this option, every field of a large image is saved to a separate file so you can perform stitching arbitrary in the future. (For example when 3x3 field array is defined then 9 images will be created). Select type of image from the list of possible formats of single images.And use the Folder field to enter a folder to save single images in.Create Both Separate single images and also one large image is created at the same time.Save Large Image to File Check this item to enable saving of the large image to a file automatically.Keep file opened Check this item to keep the file opened after it has been saved to a file.Save to Auto capture folder If selected, the captured large image is saved to the Auto Capture folder.Filename Enter or choose a filename of the new file.Format This option defines format of single images or the result image file.Folder Displays folder where single images are saved. It can be directly edited in the field, or you can look for another folder using the ... button.Stage Overview with Macro Image Overview of the XY stage is displayed in preview. It will ease the setup of the area setup. Use the following buttons: Preview You can move the view using the arrows (top, left, bottom, right) on the sides of the preview. Capture This button captures a preview image using the Macro Image settings. This image is then displayed in the preview section along with the scan area preview. The settings of the scan area may be modified by dragging the preview by mouse. Figure&nbsp;1529.&nbsp;The Macro image with the Scanning Area indicated  Size of one frame of the scan area preview is only schematically displayed in dependence on the current zoom of the preview. Since FOV (Field Of View) of the objective selected for scanning can be bigger than indicated within the preview, the area included in the resulting Large Image can be slightly bigger than the actual area settings defined within this dialog window. Clear This button deletes the captured Macro image. Fit Macro Image This button zooms at the field of view according to the Macro Image settings (current stage position + the specified objective) Fit Stage Area This button zooms at the whole area achievable by the XY stage (Stage Area).

Figure&nbsp;1768.&nbsp;Select the authentication type. Specify the user name. In case of Windows accounts, select a Windows user from the pull-down menu. In case of a password-protected account, type in the password (twice - for confirmation). Finish the process by pressing the Create button.Delete user This button displays a confirmation dialog box - when you press the OK button, the account is deleted.Change password This button sets a new password for the selected user. A dialog box with two editboxes (Password and Confirm password) appears.Change properties The Change properties button invokes the following dialog box where it is possible to set user rights (of the selected user) for various actions performed on a database. To set or ban rights, click into a check box. Figure&nbsp;1769.&nbsp;User Description Modifies the comments to a user.User rights This is used for defining, what actions are allowed to the selected user in a relation to other users and databases.Tables Displays a list of existing tables. It is possible to set the rights to view, create and delete tables, as well as the rights to create and delete fields and records in a table.Fields More detailed settings for each table are listed here. You can see only the fields that your rights allows you to view. You can set, which user will be able to view (or modify) every single field.Click the Apply button to save the changes and the Close button to end the user rights editing. If you click Close first, you will be asked, whether to store changes or not.     Database &gt; Schedule Database Backup🔗 (requires:  )This command makes periodical (or single) backups of databases. Figure&nbsp;1770.&nbsp;The possibility to backup the database is essential for a serious work. The Database Backup Scheduler backs up the database automatically once in a precisely specified time interval, so you do not have to be afraid to loose any data. The Database Scheduler uses the standard Windows Scheduled Tasks tool (Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Scheduled Tasks). Once you schedule a backup, there is only one condition to perform it successfully: The computer must be ON at the scheduled time.Task Settings  Figure&nbsp;1771.&nbsp;To set a new periodic backup, click the New Task button. In the window that appears, specify the task`s name and click OK. If you already have some task that suits your needs, it is possible to copy its properties by checking the Based on check box and choosing it s name from the list. Figure&nbsp;1772.&nbsp;Since the task is based on the Windows component, it is necessary to run it under a Windows user account. Either a local or a domain account is allowable (the domain name “LAB” is used in our example). After filling in the password, decide, how often the backup shall be performed. Daily, weekly and monthly intervals with a precision of seconds are available. Figure&nbsp;1773.&nbsp; Figure&nbsp;1774.&nbsp; Figure&nbsp;1775.&nbsp;Furthermore, the location of three following files on a disk is needed. Use the Browse buttons on the right side of the textboxes to specify the paths to the Source database file (the file to be backed up), the Destination (backup) database (a directory to which the backup file will be written) and the Backup log file where the information about the backup process is stored. The specification of all three destinations is mandatory. Without it, the backup cannot start.Detailed backup settings  Figure&nbsp;1776.&nbsp;In the Source database settings, there are the Database account and Password text boxes. Still, they are not editable and are of an informational kind.Backup history  Figure&nbsp;1777.&nbsp;When performing the backup periodically, the already existing (the latest) backup file`s con tent is moved to a new history file and a suffix with the iteration number is attached to its name. The new backup file is created. This way, an unlimited number of the history backup files is being created on a disk. When you limit the number of history files (e.g. to prevent the disk capacity overflow), each time the scheduler replaces the latest file with the new one, it also renames all files accordingly. As a result, the file names and their number on a disk do not change.Logging backup process  Figure&nbsp;1778.&nbsp;The amount of information to be written to the backup log file is determined by the Level choice. The Details option records changes of all files of a database compared to the previous backup. If you choose to record the Summary only, the possible critical errors and backup process results are included in the log file. ",

Figure&nbsp;1855.&nbsp;Check whether there is a risk of collision between the slide loader arm (gripper) and the motorized stage. If collision might occur, click Cancel, disconnect the slide loader in the device manager, turn it OFF on the rear panel of the device and move the arm manually to its home position away from the stage. The home position is when the gripper arm is facing the cassettes and is retracted so there is no risk of collision with either the cassettes or the XY stage. Figure&nbsp;1856.&nbsp;If you had to disconnect the slide loader, turn it back ON. Then reconnect it to NIS-Elements in the Device Manager and restart the initialization.If the motorized stage is clear to move, click Yes to proceed. Once more, a warning appears. Figure&nbsp;1857.&nbsp;Make sure that the stage cannot collide with a microscope objective or a condenser (see   ) and proceed by the Escape &amp; Init button.     Devices &gt; Calibrate Z🔗 (requires:  )For some devices, the Z calibration is necessary. If the Calibrate Z command is present in the Devices menu, that is the reason. The Z calibration can be done during the stage initialization or using this command.The calibration is done by manual moving to two different Z positions and by defining the distance between them. Follow the instruction given by the application. Use the joystick to move the stage to the first position and press OK. Then use the joystick to move the stage to the second position and press OK. Enter the real distance between these two Z positions in micrometers. Press OK to finish the calibration.     Devices &gt; Keep Z position and center Piezo Z🔗 (requires:  )This function moves piezo-Z logical device to its defined home position and, at the same time, moves the second Z drive in order to compensate the piezo-Z shift so that the absolute Z position remains unchanged.     Devices &gt; Move Piezo Z to Home Position🔗 (requires:  )This function moves piezo-Z logical device to its defined home position (such as the center of its physical range).     Devices &gt; Objective Clearance🔗 (requires:  )This command helps to protect microscope objectives against an accidental damage. Having a motorized Z drive connected to the system, the command can move the objectives by the defined distance off the current position before the stage initialization or the automatic objective change is performed. Figure&nbsp;1858.&nbsp;Run the Enable Objective Clearance command. The pictured window appears.Check the box and the clearance operation will be performed every time an objective is changed or the stage is initialized. If not checked, no action will be taken.Adjust the Objective distance value which is a distance that the Z drive will travel of the current position.Confirm the settings by pressing OK.     Devices &gt; Objectives XY Offset Setup🔗 Optical axis is a little different between two objective lenses on a nosepiece. This function opens the Objective XY Offset dialog where it is possible to define XY offsets between objectives. Click   Add, select objectives for the calibration and click OK.Click   Start Capturing on the first objective, position your sample to target reference objects with the crosses and click   Capture.Do this again for the second objective. Compare the capture results and make sure they are correctly positioned.When done, click   Finish. The new offset is calculated and listed in the table. Load This button appears if a Ti2 microscope is connected and enables the user to load offset settings directly from the microscope. While Ti2 is controlled by NIS-Elements, Ti2 offset settings defined via the Ti2 Assist software are disabled. This is the way to load them and use them within NIS-Elements.     Devices &gt; Apply Objectives XY Offset🔗 Applies XY offsets between objectives based on the values set in the Objective XY Offset dialog window (see:   ).     Devices &gt; Mouse Joystick and Auto Focus Z🔗 If there is more than one Z drive connected, this submenu enables you to select the primary one. The following commands are affected by the selection:      The following commands do NOT respect the selection:         Devices &gt; Enable Mouse Joystick Z in Live🔗 (requires:  )When the logical device Z drive is present in the system (does not matter which physical device it is a part of), this command appears in the Devices menu.If you activate it, the mouse wheel will be used for focusing (moving the Z drive) and not for zooming the image while in the live mode. The focusing step can be adjusted by the use of the    command from the Devices menu.     Devices &gt; Mouse Joystick Setup🔗 Sets the Z-step used for focusing by a mouse wheel. The focusing is done by a mouse wheel when the    command is ON. Figure&nbsp;1859.&nbsp;Step Indicates the z-step in micrometers. To change it, you can:enter the intended Z-step valueclick the nearby “default value” button.click the arrow buttons, move the slider, or rotate the mouse-wheel to browse the predefined values.Default value This button sets the slider to a value optimized for the currently selected objective. If no objective is active, the default value is 5 µm. Default value is computed as half of Z-Step (AF) - a value defined for each objective. See   .  Minimal mouse joystick step has been adjusted according to the connected Z device. For example, Ti Z Drive minimal step is 25 nm, MCL NanoDrive minimal step is 10 nm.See Also&nbsp;       Devices &gt; Fast Auto Focus Setup🔗 Adjusts settings to be used by the    command.See also  .Range, Absolute Select a way the focusing range is specified and enter the required values.Criterion Select the focus criterion according to the type of experiment.Automatic A criterion suitable for the current light path will be selected automatically.Brightfield Uses DIA illumination.Confocal Uses a confocal microscope.Fluorescence Uses EPI illumination.Closed Aperture Cells.ai, Opened Aperture Cells.ai .ai-based brightfield criterions intended for a thin layer of cells in a PBS. Unlike the Brightfield criterion, they does not mis-detect scratches for cells. Specific hardware settings are required:Closed Aperture DIA illumination, aperture: 0.02.Opened Aperture DIA illumination, aperture: open (0.15 for 10x objective, 0.24 for 20x objective).Brightfield Criterion Select a criterion to be used if the Automatic option determines the current modality is brightfield.     Devices &gt; Fast Auto Focus🔗 Starts automatic focusing according to the settings defined by the    command. It uses a continuous movement of the Z drive and therefore it is usually much faster than the    command.See also  .     Devices &gt; Auto Focus Setup🔗 Sets the focusing method and parameters. The focus setup window appears. Each time the    command is run, the auto focus method which is currently selected within this window is used. There are the following methods available: Steps in Range and Continuous in Range.Steps in Range&nbsp;The Steps in Range method moves the Z drive in steps within a defined range. The Z position with the best focus criterion is used as “focused”. Figure&nbsp;1860.&nbsp;Two passes Select this option to perform auto focus in two steps: Coarse and Fine.Step, Coarse Step, Fine Step, Recommended step value Define the step size (distance between two Z positions) in micrometers. There is a button left of the Range field which indicates a step size recommended for the current objective magnification. Click the button to insert the value to the “step” field.Range Define the total distance which the Z drive will use for auto focus.Criterion Defines which focus criterion is used:Brightfield Standard contrast based criterion.Fluorescence Suitable for fluorescence microscopy.Confocal Criterion based only on the intensity values. Can be useful in confocal microscopy.Yeast, Bacteria (Ph) A criterion optimized for yeasts under phase contrast (Ph) microscope.Offset Z after AF This option may be useful in fluorescence applications for the cases where the auto focus algorithm produces offset (the system states it is focused but you would like to focus on some other objects within the image, which are blurry). After performing auto focus, the Z drive will move by the distance defined within this field.Close active shutter during stage movement The active shutter will close in times between acquisitions phases. Typically, this option is used to reduce the photo-bleaching effect on live cells.Use Opt. Conf.: Select an existing optical configuration.Test Press this button to start focusing immediately. If everything works fine, click the Save and Close button to apply the setting.  When working with low-magnification objectives (4x for example) use higher steps (like 10 microns). For higher magnifying microscopic objectives (for example 40x) use lower steps (like 3 microns). Also, the travel range should be adjusted for each objective. For example the travel range for a 20x objective should be about 100 micrometers. Be sure not to enter higher travel range than half of the working distance of the objective. For explanation, please see the picture. Figure&nbsp;1861.&nbsp;Continuous in Range (requires Nikon Ni or Ti2-E microscope)&nbsp; Figure&nbsp;1862.&nbsp;This method is similar to the Steps in range except that in this case, the step size depends on the camera frame rate. See above for description of the other options.Speed Select how fast the Z drive will go through the range (fast/slow/normal). Use slow speed for maximum precision of the autofocus.  If the Continuous in range two-pass auto focus fails the reason may be:Camera exposure time is not compatible (too short or too long) with the speed of your Z drive.The automatically calculated coarse step is too large and the specimen is thin so it does not come into focus at all.Try reducing the auto focus speed to Slow, adjust camera the exposure time, or use the Single pass mode.     Devices &gt; Auto Focus🔗 Starts automatic focusing according to the settings defined by the    command. The focusing respects the probe setting. If the probe is not activated, the focusing is done in the full picture. Switch the probe on (for example by the Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P hotkey) to focus only inside the probe area.     Devices &gt; Find PFS Offset🔗 Turns the PFS on and finds the offset value so that it corresponds to the current Z-drive position. The PFS must be off for this command to be enabled.     Devices &gt; Auto PFS Focus Setup🔗 Define settings to be used when the    command is called. Figure&nbsp;1863.&nbsp;The settings equal the    command with the difference that you can select between micrometers and PFS units here.Criterion Defines which focus criterion is used:Brightfield Standard contrast based criterion.Fluorescence Suitable for fluorescence microscopy.Confocal Criterion based only on the intensity values. Can be useful in confocal microscopy.Yeast, Bacteria (Ph) A criterion optimized for yeasts under phase contrast (Ph) microscope.AF mode Auto Automatic focus mode, only the range shall be defined. The system calculates optimal step and whether 1 pass or 2 passes will be performed.Manual Manual focusing mode enabling further settings. The focusing range and step in the first and second pass can be defined manually.Use OC Select an existing optical configuration.Range Define the total distance which the Z drive will use for auto focus either in µm or PFS units.Exclude Border This function excludes the border of the image and uses only the central part for focus. Width of the excluded border in percent can be set in the edit box.Step Define the step size (distance between two Z positions) in µm or PFS units. There is a button on the right which indicates the step size recommended for the current objective magnification. Click the button to insert the value.Single pass Single pass performs auto focus in one step. This is a standard auto focus method which can be used.Two passes This method is suitable when you are far out of focus. It is performed in two steps: Coarse and Fine. If the Continuous in range two-pass auto focus fails the reason may be:Camera exposure time is not compatible (too short or too long) with the speed of your Z drive.The automatically calculated coarse step is too large and the specimen is thin so it does not come into focus at all.Try reducing the auto focus speed to Slow, adjust camera the exposure time, or use the Single pass mode.Test Press this button to test the current settings and start focusing immediately.Save and Close Applies the current settings and closes the dialog window.Cancel Closes the dialog window without applying any settings.     Devices &gt; Auto PFS Focus🔗 This command tries to find the best focused image plane and set the PFS Offset accordingly. It is very similar to the    with the difference that the result of Auto Focus is a Z-position while the result of Auto PFS Focus is the PFS Offset value. However, both commands should lead to a focused image.     Devices &gt; Focus Surface Setup🔗 This command enables you to compensate systematical focus trends caused by a badly adjusted (not even) stage or by a sloping specimen.It opens the XYZ Overview control window. See    for more information.     Devices &gt; Focus using Surface🔗 This command performs planar interpolation of points to calculate the focus.     Devices &gt; Set PFS offset from PFS Surface🔗 This commands sets a PFS Offset value for the current XY position based on the active PFS surface. Imagine PFS surface as a grid of PFS Offset values. This grid enables the system to produce a PFS Offset value for any point within the stage XY coordinate system. The PFS surface can be only created using the    module.     Devices &gt; Reset PFS Surface🔗 If a PFS surface is defined, this command deletes it. See   .     Devices &gt; Scanning Setup🔗 Sets up parameters for automatic scanning.

You can also select the [More] option to define a custom channel color.Open the file afterwards If checked then the created ND2 file is opened in the application after the conversion.Convert Create the ND2 file according to the given properties.How to create a common ND2 file automatically&nbsp;This is the easiest way of creating the ND2 file. All you need to have is a properly indexed source data, which typically means to have sequence of images named like this:prefix index1 string index2 string index3 .. e.g.: “seq_Z1T1”.string , prefix - is recognized as any combination of letters. “seq_Z” stands for a prefix and “T” for a string in the example. It is possible to use the filenames in the form [*010101.*] with [Create ND File from File Sequence] dialog to automatically create ND file with the dimension coordinates specified by the filenames.Set the ND Experiment Shape to the Get from File Names mode.Browse for the image sequence within the Directories portion of the window.All images of the selected directory appear in the list of files in the middle of the window.There might be several sequences in the directory. Just click on one file of the desired sequence and it will be detected automatically (under condition of having different prefixes). Other files will look disabled (gray).When a sequence is selected, the filenames are automatically searched for the indexes, and the indexes are marked with color according to dimension types selected in the above pull-down menus.Change the dimension order by selecting from the pull-down menus, if needed.Check, whether the system recognized the right image order, and define the properties of selected dimensions in the rightmost portion of the window.Click Convert to start the ND2 file creation. The file will be placed as defined in the Output File Name field.Dimensions The Timelapse properties enables you to set the time between images manually (specify period), or to count the time from file attributes (Read File Creation time), or use the records stored inside the files captured with NIS-Elements (Read from Acquisition Time).The Z-Series properties requires to define a z-step. This can be filled in manually or let the system read it from the image data.You can define the Wavelength properties: the name, the color, and the optical configuration that was used for capturing each channel.How to create a common ND2 file manually&nbsp;If there is an image sequence which is not indexed properly, the ND2 file can be created manually.Set the ND Experiment Shape to the Define Manually mode.Select the dimension types from the combo boxes to define the dimensions order.Define the number of loops for each dimension in the Statistics portion of the window.Set the filtering conditions through the Advanced File Filter dialog.Select one file of the files in the list to determine the image sequence (images with the same prefix are automatically selected).Specify the Dimensions properties in the right portion of the window.Confirm the options by the Convert button.     File &gt; Import/Export &gt; Create JSON File Sequence Description🔗 Saves information about a sequence of images to a JSON file. This file can then be processed as an ND2 file without actually creating one. This is useful when conversion to ND2 would copy lots of image data (hundreds of GB), and especially when the file is to be processed further more in NIS-Elements (e.g. Deconvolution, Denoise, ...) which involves saving. Therefore the JSON file format is a transient format with limited functionality.The options of the dialog correspond to the    command.     File &gt; Import/Export &gt; Export ND Document🔗 All frames of an ND2 file can be saved as single image files by this command. Tiff and JPEG2000 file formats are supported.

File &gt; Open/Save Next &gt; Open Previous🔗 The system tracks the opening and saving operations and then tries to open the 'previous' image in your working directory. Example: when you open image 'seq4.lim' by    command, this command will open 'seq3.lim' image. Let's suppose that seq1.lim, ..., seq100.lim images were saved in the same directory.     File &gt; Open/Save Next &gt; Open Next🔗 The system tracks the opening and saving operations and then tries to open the 'next' image in your working directory. The behavior of this command differs:The current file was opened via Organizer When you set some sorting, filtering, or grouping in Organizer (for both DB records and files), and then open an image by Organizer, the applied sorting is maintained also for the    command. Furthermore, the sorting criterion is copied to the   .The current file was opened via the Open command When you opened an image by the    command (does not matter if in the Organizer or Image layout), the    command uses settings of the   .

File &gt; Merge Channels🔗 Merges images displaying the same scene into one image. Each of them is usually captured under different illumination and using different optical filters and different camera settings. It combines color planes stored in separate files into one RGB image. The following dialog appears: Figure&nbsp;1488.&nbsp;The function can take up to three monochrome (fluorescence) images and one color/monochrome (bright field) image. If a color image is inserted into one of the mono channels instead of the monochrome one, the appropriate image component is extracted. The bright field can be either color or monochrome. Monochrome images are transferred into the appropriate color components of the result image which is then blended with the bright field using a special formula. Each source image can be skipped if the user selects the &lt;None&gt; option. If bright field is skipped, the source components can be later easily extracted from the blended image by the    command. If the source images are of different sizes, all of them are stretched to the maximum size - images acquired with a different camera binning or resolution can be merged.Red Component, Green Component, Blue Component Selects a source image (must be opened in NIS-Elements) for defined component.Brightfield Selects a source image for bright field.     File &gt; Merge ND Documents🔗 Combines all opened image files to form one ND2 file. However, reasonable results will be achieved only if the format (size, number of dimensions, etc.) of the images match. If channel properties of files which were captured by different cameras match and these files are merged, the “acquisition details” meta-information is merged as well and one of the camera names is omitted.Please see   . Figure&nbsp;1489.&nbsp;Merge ND Documents window.Dialog OptionsOpened Documents Names of all image files currently opened in the software will appear on the right side.Select those you do not want to merge and use the &lt;&lt; button to remove them from the list on the right.Use the arrow buttons to adjust order of the files (see   below).Click OK.Files in Folder Click the ... button and browse for the folder where your images are saved.Choose whether to include images placed in Subfolders in the list.Select images to be merged in the left column and use the &gt;&gt; button to add them to the list on the right.Use the arrow buttons to adjust order of the files (see   below).Click OK.Create custom dimension from files The result will contain a Custom dimension. Each of the merged files will form one loop of this dimension. Use this option when merging Time-lapse files which would otherwise form a single-dimension image sequence.Ignore stage positions This option ignores stage coordinates and merges the files without creating multi-points if there is a multi-point dimension present in the merged files. Merging RulesThe following rules are applied when merging (ND2) images.Order If multiple images are processed, only two images are merged at a time. After the first two images are merged, the resulting ND2 file is merged with the 3rd image, etc.Minimum of Frames It would be easy for the algorithm to take the sum of all frames and put it in a row one after another. However, the algorithm tests all frames for similarities and tries to reduce the final frames count.Example: Merging of two single-frame RGB images results in a two-frame RGB ND2 file. However, merging of one single-channel (blue) image with a two-channel (red, green) image results in a single-frame RGB image (in other words, the system prefers one-frame three-channel image to three-frame single-channel image).Matching Z Stacks Only Two ND2 files both containing Z-Stack can be merged if only the Z-stack acquisition details (number of frames and their Z-positions) match. A Z-stack ND2 image can be combined with a single-frame image, the single-frame will be placed to the top, home or bottom position according to its absolute Z position (written in metadata). The tolerance for Z-stack merging was increased to one half of the Z-step size, or at least to 0.1um.Dummy Frames Example: Image A: a single-frame image; image B: an XY+Z ND2 file.If images A and B are merged, it will force one extra XY frame to be created in the resulting ND2 file. However, in this extra XY frame, only one Z-frame can be filled with the contents of Image A (According to the previous rule). Other Z frames will be filled with dummy (black) frames. In other words: dummy frames are created automatically if the ND2 file structure requires it but the image data are not available.Matching Point Names Merge When merging XY (multipoint) dimension, XY points with matching names will be merged to one point regardless of their XY coordinates. This enables you to influence the way how XY points will be merged: points with matching names are always merged together while points with different names are merged into one only if the XY coordinates match. This rule does not apply to default point names (#1, #2, etc.) - when default names are used, only points with matching position are merged.     File &gt; Stitch Large Image from Files🔗 Creates large images from a sequence of files that were captured separately. The following window appears: Figure&nbsp;1490.&nbsp;To load sequence of images: Click Open Image Sequence.The Load Image Sequence dialog appears: Figure&nbsp;1491.&nbsp;Browse for the directory where the sequence is saved.Select the files to be loaded by defining the File Names restriction. (e.g. “Large” will restrict the selection only to files beginning with the word “Large”).Click OK. The dialog closes and the selected files are loaded to the main window.Creating Large Image The preview of loaded images is arranged inside the window according to the value set in the Columns or Rows field. The field name depends on the selection of direction: Vertical or Horizontal.Select whether the images were captured in meander or rows direction and set the position of the First frame.Choose the Overlap rate from the combo box. Select the best value according to the preview image.  Auto scale automatically sets LUTs for better visualization.If you check the Image Registration option, the images will be merged using a special algorithm which tries to fit and smooth the edges.The Crop border option crops the large image so that no background (caused by the image registration algorithm) will be included in the result. When image registration is used and the result is not cropped, it contains asymmetric black borders.Stitching option is used to select a stitching method (see:  ). Blending method blends the overlapping image parts and Optimal path method computes a contour in places where two overlapping images are least different and then they are stitched copying this contour.Shading correction function is appropriate for sufficient stitching of homogeneous images. Check Automatic shading correction to turn the function on and choose the type of correction which best represents the background of your sample image. If Automatically per channel is selected, the shading modality method is detected and applied per channel. For more information about shading correction, please see:   .When done with setting all of the options, click Stitch. When the stitching process finishes, the large image is opened as a new image called “Large Image #”.     File &gt; Image Properties🔗,     Image Properties This command opens the Image Properties dialog. The dialog appearance may vary according to the type of image. In case you are inspecting an ND2 file properties all the following tabs are accessible. Figure&nbsp;1492.&nbsp;Image Attributes Displays the file properties which are provided by the system.

Please refer to the   chapter for further details. Dilate  Erode  Close  Open  Separate Objects Automatically  Clean  Fill Holes  Clear Erases all binary objects     View &gt; Analysis Controls &gt; Colocalization 🔗 Colocalization characterizes the degree of overlap between two different fluorescent labels, each having a separate emission wavelength. Practically it displays graphical representation of the intensity distribution of two channels. This is helpful while segmenting images. Also colocalization reports statistical information about the entire image, or a ROI, respectively. NIS-Elements estimates colocalization by calculating several colocalization coefficients. The colocalization is represented by a scattergram. Figure&nbsp;1810.&nbsp;The scattergram indicates a degree of coincidence of overlapping pixels. All possible combinations of pixel intensities of the selected color channels are displayed within the scattergram. Intensity of each point in the scattergram is proportional to the number of pixels with the corresponding intensity combination (purple = low accumulation of the particular intensity combination, green = high accumulation).Select the channels to be included in the calculation from the pull-down menus.Scattergram is displayed inside the control window.Colocalization coefficients are displayed at the bottom.Colocalization toolsChannel selection Choose the two channels from the pull down menus.Export The colocalization coefficients can be exported out of NIS-Elements. Please, refer to the   chapter. Keep Updating Binary If turned ON, the binary layer is updated during some user actions such as browsing through an ND2 document. Save/Load Colocalize Configuration Saves / loads the colocalization settings under a user defined name. Zoom In Zooms in the scattergram. The zoom size is indicated at the end of both axes. Zoom Out Zooms out the scattergram. The zoom size is indicated at the end of both axes. Graph Autoscale If zoomed in, this button returns the scattergram zoom back to 100%. Rectangular selection A binary layer will be created over pixels of the image with values that fit the rectangular area of the scattergram. Sector selection Works in the same way as the rectangular selection. Move the yellow radius line and adjust the concentric circles to delimit the area of interest. X and Y offset of the whole sector can be set in the edit boxes on the right side. Threshold on Pearson's correlation This tool highlights the pixels which fit the defined degree of correlation. The percentage threshold can be set in the edit box which appears when you activate the tool.

One binary layer represents the colocalized area defined by the yellow radius lines and concentric circles (“Colocalization” area in the picture below) and two layers represent the rest of the channel intensity combinations available (red and green areas in the picture below). Figure&nbsp;1811.&nbsp;Three binary layers created after using the Generate 3 binaries functionStatistic toolsImage statistics are displayed at the bottom part of the control window.Calculations are based on the paper:  .Pearson's correlation This value indicates an overlap of two channels. It is independent from the image background. Ri ... red channel intensity in the i-th pixelGi ... green channel intensity in the i-th pixelRavg ... average red channel intensityGavg ... average green channel intensityMander's overlap This value indicates an overlap of two channels - it is not dependent on the relative strengths of the channels, but depends on the background. Mander's overlap coefficients The coefficients k1 and k2 describe intensity variations between channel 1 and channel 2. Values depend on the intensities of two channels. They are sensitive to the difference in the channel intensities. Colocalization coefficients The coefficients c1 and c2 (often documented as M1 and M2) describe contribution of each channel to the overall colocalization. Values are not sensitive to channel intensities. They can be used when the numbers of objects are not equal.  where Ri,coloc = Ri ... if Gi &gt; 0, Ri,coloc = 0 ... if Gi = 0   where Gi,coloc = Gi ... if Ri &gt; 0, Gi,coloc = 0 ... if Ri = 0     View &gt; Analysis Controls &gt; Distance Measurement 🔗 Distance Measurement panel provides a full set of measurement tools arranged into six main groups (tabs).
